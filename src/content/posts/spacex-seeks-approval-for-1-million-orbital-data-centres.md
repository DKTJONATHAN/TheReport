# SpaceX Seeks Approval for 1 Million Orbital Data Centres

## Introduction and Source-Led Overview

According to a federal filing reported by TechCrunch on 31 January 2026, SpaceX has formally requested regulatory approval to deploy a constellation of 1 million solar-powered satellite data centres. The filing, submitted to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), outlines a massive expansion of the company’s existing orbital infrastructure, moving beyond simple telecommunications into large-scale orbital computing and energy harvesting. TechCrunch reports that the documentation identifies this initiative as a foundational step in a long-term strategy to transition humanity toward a Kardashev II-level civilisation. This classification refers to a society capable of harnessing the total energy output of its parent star.

The proposal represents a significant increase in the scale of satellite deployments previously managed by the aerospace firm. While the current Starlink constellation consists of several thousand satellites, the new request for 1 million units suggests a shift in both the density and the functional purpose of the company’s hardware in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Experts in the field of aerospace regulation note that the scale of this request is unprecedented, requiring extensive review by multiple federal agencies, including the FCC, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## Background of SpaceX Orbital Infrastructure

The development of this new proposal follows nearly a decade of iterative progress within SpaceX’s satellite division. Since the first experimental Starlink launches in 2018, the company has focused on providing high-speed, low-latency internet to underserved regions. By 2024, the constellation had grown to support millions of users globally, utilizing a network of ground stations and inter-satellite laser links. However, the transition from communication relays to dedicated data centres marks a pivot in the company’s business model.

Data centres in space offer several theoretical advantages that have been discussed by aerospace engineers for years. These include the availability of constant solar energy without atmospheric interference, the natural cooling properties of the vacuum of space, and the reduction of latency for global data processing. By placing the "edge" of the cloud in orbit, SpaceX aims to process data closer to the point of collection, whether that data originates from other satellites, aircraft, or ground-based sensors. The filing indicates that these 1 million satellites would be equipped with advanced processing units and high-capacity solar arrays, designed to function as a distributed supercomputer.

## Key Developments in the Federal Filing

The specific details of the filing, as highlighted by TechCrunch, focus on the dual-purpose nature of the proposed hardware. Each satellite is intended to serve as both a computational node and an energy collector. The mention of the Kardashev scale in a federal document is a notable departure from standard regulatory language. The Kardashev scale, proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964, measures a civilisation's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is able to use. A Type I civilisation uses all available resources on its home planet, while a Type II civilisation harnesses the full energy output of its star, typically through structures like a Dyson Sphere.

SpaceX’s filing claims that the deployment of 1 million solar-powered satellites is a "first step" toward this goal. The document suggests that by creating a dense shell of energy-harvesting and data-processing units around the Earth, the company can begin the process of large-scale solar energy capture that exceeds current terrestrial capabilities. The technical specifications included in the filing describe a new class of satellite, likely larger and more power-intensive than the current Starlink V2 Mini or V2 models. These units would require the heavy-lift capabilities of the Starship launch system to reach orbit in the quantities proposed.

## Technical and Environmental Impacts

The proposal to launch 1 million satellites carries significant implications for the orbital environment. One of the primary concerns raised by the scientific community is the risk of orbital congestion and the potential for the Kessler Syndrome, a scenario where a single collision could trigger a chain reaction of debris, rendering certain orbits unusable. SpaceX has stated in previous filings that its satellites are equipped with autonomous collision-avoidance systems and are designed to de-orbit at the end of their operational life, burning up in the atmosphere. However, the sheer volume of 1 million units presents a statistical challenge for space traffic management.

Furthermore, the environmental impact of frequent launches required to sustain such a constellation is a point of ongoing debate. The carbon emissions from rocket propellant and the deposition of alumina and other particles in the upper atmosphere during re-entry are areas of active study. The filing suggests that the use of solar power for data processing could offset some of the carbon footprint associated with terrestrial data centres, which currently consume approximately 1 to 2 per cent of global electricity. By moving these energy-intensive operations into space, the company argues it can provide a more sustainable long-term solution for the world's growing computational needs.

## Industry and Scientific Reactions

The reaction from the aerospace and technology sectors has been a mixture of scrutiny and interest. Competitors in the satellite internet market, such as Amazon’s Project Kuiper and OneWeb, have yet to comment officially on the filing, but industry analysts suggest that such a massive expansion could lead to further legal challenges regarding orbital shell allocations. Astronomers have also expressed concern regarding the impact on ground-based observations. Even with brightness-mitigation techniques, a constellation of 1 million satellites would significantly alter the night sky, potentially interfering with sensitive astronomical surveys and the detection of near-Earth objects.

From a scientific perspective, the invocation of the Kardashev II-level civilisation has sparked discussion among physicists and futurists. While the goal of harnessing the Sun’s full power is a staple of theoretical science, the practical application of this through a satellite constellation is a new frontier. Critics argue that 1 million satellites, while numerous, are still a far cry from the requirements of a true Dyson-style structure. However, proponents suggest that the infrastructure for orbital energy transmission and large-scale space-based manufacturing must begin with a robust, power-positive satellite network.

## Regulatory Hurdles and Next Steps

The path to approval for SpaceX’s proposal is expected to be lengthy and complex. The FCC must evaluate the radio frequency interference that 1 million satellites might cause to existing services. Additionally, the FAA must assess the launch cadence required to deploy such a volume of hardware. International bodies, such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), may also become involved, as orbital slots and frequency spectrum are considered limited global resources.

The filing does not provide a specific timeline for the completion of the 1 million-unit constellation, but it does outline a phased approach. The first phase would likely involve the launch of prototype data centre satellites to test the efficiency of solar-to-compute conversion in the space environment. Following successful testing, the company would scale up production and launch frequency. The filing indicates that the Starship launch vehicle will be the primary method of transport, given its projected ability to carry over 100 tonnes to LEO per flight.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

The SpaceX filing for 1 million solar-powered satellite data centres represents a significant expansion of the company’s ambitions in space. By linking the project to the Kardashev scale, the company has framed its commercial goals within a broader narrative of civilisational advancement. The transition from a communications provider to an orbital energy and data infrastructure provider marks a new chapter in the commercialisation of space.

As federal agencies begin their review of the documentation, the global community will be watching closely to see how the balance between technological progress and orbital sustainability is maintained. The details of the filing, as reported by TechCrunch, suggest that the next decade of space activity will be defined by unprecedented levels of infrastructure development. Whether this "first step" leads to a Kardashev II-level civilisation remains a matter of long-term observation, but the immediate impact on the aerospace industry and regulatory frameworks is already evident. The outcome of this filing will likely set the precedent for all future large-scale orbital projects.
