# Sasini Sells Kiambu Estate for Sh7.9bn as NSE Stocks Rise

The Kenyan capital markets recorded significant activity this week, characterised by a major multi-billion shilling asset divestment by Sasini PLC and a positive shift in the share prices of several blue-chip companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. Sasini PLC, a prominent agribusiness firm, confirmed the sale of a coffee estate located in Kiambu County for a total consideration of Sh7.9 billion. Simultaneously, the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) reported upward price movements for Safaricom, East African Breweries Limited (EABL), and Kenya Power, following the announcement of higher interim dividends. These developments occur as the NSE leadership, under Chief Executive Officer Frank Mwiti, initiates a strategic shift towards collective investment schemes to increase retail investor participation in the local market. In contrast to the gains seen in the equities market, the music streaming platform Mdundo reported a 25 per cent decline in sales, despite the company’s ongoing efforts to integrate mobile payment solutions into its business model.

## Background on Sasini PLC and the Kiambu Divestment

Sasini PLC is a publicly traded company on the Nairobi Securities Exchange, primarily involved in the production, processing, and marketing of tea, coffee, avocado, and macadamia nuts. The company has historically maintained extensive land holdings in various parts of Kenya, particularly in the central highlands and the Rift Valley regions. The announcement of the sale of its coffee estate in Kiambu for Sh7.9 billion represents one of the largest corporate real estate transactions in the Kenyan agricultural sector in recent years.

The Kiambu region, where the estate is situated, has undergone significant transformation over the last decade. Historically a primary zone for coffee and tea production, the area has seen a steady transition towards residential and commercial real estate development due to its proximity to the capital city, Nairobi. Sasini PLC has previously indicated in its financial reports a strategy of optimising its asset base, which includes the potential disposal of non-core assets or land that offers higher value through alternative use. The Sh7.9 billion realisation from this sale is expected to impact the company’s balance sheet significantly, providing liquidity that may be utilised for debt reduction, reinvestment into other agricultural segments, or distribution to shareholders.

The specific details regarding the buyer of the Kiambu estate and the intended future use of the land remain undisclosed in the initial reports. However, the scale of the transaction aligns with the broader trend of large-scale land conversions in the Kiambu outskirts. Sasini’s coffee division has faced various market cycles, influenced by international coffee prices and local production costs, and this divestment marks a shift in the company’s operational footprint within the Kiambu coffee-growing belt.

## Key Developments in the Nairobi Securities Exchange

The Nairobi Securities Exchange is currently implementing a strategy to revitalise investor interest and increase the liquidity of listed securities. Frank Mwiti, the Chief Executive Officer of the NSE, has publicly stated that the exchange is placing a significant emphasis on funds, such as unit trusts and exchange-traded funds, to encourage broader participation from the Kenyan public. This strategy is designed to move away from a reliance on direct individual stock picking, which can be perceived as higher risk by retail investors, towards managed investment vehicles that offer diversification.

The NSE has faced challenges in recent years, including capital flight by foreign investors and a decline in the valuation of several listed entities. By betting on funds, the NSE aims to tap into the growing pool of domestic savings held by retail investors who may not have the expertise to manage individual portfolios but are seeking exposure to the capital markets. This approach involves collaboration with fund managers and investment banks to create products that are accessible and transparent.

In tandem with these strategic initiatives, the market responded positively to corporate actions from three of the exchange’s largest entities. Safaricom, East African Breweries Limited, and Kenya Power all witnessed an increase in their share prices. This movement was directly attributed to the declaration of interim dividends that exceeded previous market expectations. For Safaricom, which remains the most capitalised company on the NSE, dividend announcements are a primary driver of market sentiment. Similarly, EABL and Kenya Power, as essential players in the consumer goods and energy sectors respectively, play a critical role in determining the direction of the NSE 20 Share Index and the NSE All Share Index.

## Impacts of Dividend Announcements on Blue-Chip Stocks

The rise in share prices for Safaricom, EABL, and Kenya Power reflects a renewed investor appetite for yield-generating assets. In a high-interest-rate environment, investors often seek companies that provide consistent cash returns through dividends. The decision by these companies to increase their interim payouts suggests a level of confidence in their cash flow positions and operational stability.

Safaricom’s performance is often viewed as a barometer for the wider Kenyan economy. The company’s ability to maintain and grow its dividend distributions is linked to the performance of its mobile money platform, M-Pesa, and its data business. The positive price movement indicates that the market has reacted favourably to the company’s latest financial disclosures.

East African Breweries Limited, a subsidiary of Diageo, has also demonstrated resilience in a competitive regional market. The increase in its interim dividend is a signal to the market regarding its ability to manage inflationary pressures and maintain profitability. For Kenya Power, the national electricity distributor, the rise in stock price and the dividend announcement are notable given the company’s historical financial volatility. The utility firm has been working on various turnaround strategies to improve its debt profile and operational efficiency, and the latest dividend declaration is seen as a factual indicator of improved financial health.

The cumulative effect of these price gains has provided a boost to the total market capitalisation of the NSE. When the largest companies by market weight experience price appreciation, it tends to lift the overall indices, potentially attracting further interest from both domestic and institutional investors.

## Financial Performance and Challenges for Mdundo

While the traditional corporate sectors showed signs of growth, the digital music streaming sector faced hurdles. Mdundo, a pan-African music service that is listed on the Danish stock exchange but has a significant operational presence in Kenya and other African markets, reported a 25 per cent drop in sales. This decline occurred despite the company’s strategic push into mobile payment integrations.

Mdundo has been working to convert its large user base into paying subscribers by partnering with telecommunications companies to allow for easy payment through mobile airtime and mobile money. The 25 per cent decrease in sales suggests that the transition from a free, ad-supported model to a premium, paid model is encountering resistance or that advertising revenues have softened. The company has previously focused on high-growth markets such as Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania, aiming to provide a localised alternative to global streaming giants.

The drop in revenue highlights the complexities of the digital economy in Africa, where consumer spending power is often constrained and the willingness to pay for digital content is still developing. Mdundo’s reliance on mobile payments was intended to bypass the low penetration of credit cards on the continent, but the latest financial figures indicate that this strategy has not yet offset other revenue declines. The company continues to operate in a highly competitive environment, facing pressure from both international platforms and local competitors.

## Reactions and Market Context

The reaction to Sasini’s Sh7.9 billion sale has been one of close observation by market analysts and stakeholders in the agricultural sector. The transaction is factual evidence of the high value placed on land in the Kiambu area, which often exceeds the agricultural productive value of the soil. For Sasini shareholders, the focus is now on how the board of directors will allocate the proceeds from the sale.

In the broader market, the NSE’s focus on funds is a response to the changing demographics of investors in Kenya. There is an increasing number of young, tech-savvy individuals who are looking for investment opportunities but require simplified entry points. The NSE’s push for collective investment schemes is an attempt to institutionalise retail trading, making the market less volatile and more attractive for long-term capital.

The performance of Safaricom, EABL, and Kenya Power has provided a temporary reprieve from the bearish trend that has characterised the NSE for much of the past year. The fact that these companies can afford to pay higher dividends in a challenging economic climate is a point of interest for institutional investors who are re-evaluating their positions in frontier markets.

## Next Steps for the Involved Entities

Following the completion of the Kiambu estate sale, Sasini PLC is expected to provide a detailed breakdown of the transaction in its next regulatory filing. This will include the impact on its earnings per share and any changes to its operational strategy for the remaining coffee and tea estates. The company’s future focus may shift more heavily towards its emerging avocado and macadamia lines, which have been identified as high-growth areas in previous annual reports.

The NSE will continue to roll out its programme to promote funds. This includes investor education campaigns and the streamlining of the listing process for new investment products. The success of this strategy will be measured by the growth in the number of active investment accounts and the total assets under management within the collective investment schemes.

For Safaricom, EABL, and Kenya Power, the next steps involve maintaining the operational efficiencies that allowed for the increased dividend payouts. Investors will be looking at the full-year results to see if the interim performance can be sustained. In the case of Kenya Power, the focus remains on the implementation of the government-backed recovery plan and the management of its power purchase agreements.

Mdundo is expected to review its subscription and payment strategies in light of the 25 per cent sales drop. The company may need to adjust its marketing spend or seek new partnerships to stimulate revenue growth in its key markets. The digital streaming landscape remains fluid, and the company’s ability to adapt to consumer behaviour will be critical for its financial recovery.

The Kenyan business environment remains a mix of traditional asset realisations and modern digital transitions. The Sh7.9 billion Sasini deal and the dividend-led rally on the NSE provide a factual basis for assessing the current health of the country’s corporate sector, while the challenges faced by Mdundo serve as a reminder of the volatility inherent in the digital services market. These events collectively define the current economic narrative in the region, as companies navigate a landscape of shifting asset values and evolving investor preferences.
