# THE RECLAMATION OF THE ANTHEM: WHY BRANDI CARLILE IS SINGING TO A DIVIDED SUPER BOWL

Brandi Carlile is set to perform "America the Beautiful" at Super Bowl LX, a choice that serves as a deliberate reclamation of American patriotism for the queer community. Amidst a backdrop of political boycotts and a growing movement for an "alternative" halftime show designed to cater to conservative viewers unhappy with Bad Bunny, Carlile’s performance with SistaStrings is an attempt to use the song’s aspirational, self-correcting lyrics to address a nation she describes as being in a state of "fragile hope." She is not just singing a song, she is positioning herself as a bridge between a traditionalist past and a marginalized present, specifically highlighting that the song’s author, Katharine Lee Bates, was almost certainly a gay woman.

The performance, scheduled for Sunday in San Francisco, comes at a moment when the Super Bowl itself has become a proxy for the American culture war. With an expected audience of over 125 million people, the stakes are not merely musical. Carlile is opting to perform the piece at the very top of her vocal range, a move she describes as "coming out swinging." By choosing a "melodically centred" arrangement rather than a rhythmic or bombastic one, she is stripping the song of its usual military or triumphalist overtones and forcing the audience to listen to the words themselves, words that ask God to "mend thine every flaw."

## The Ghost of Katharine Lee Bates

To understand why Carlile is doing this, you have to look at the history she is invoking. Katharine Lee Bates was a social activist, a poet, and a woman who lived in a long-term "Boston marriage" with fellow professor Katharine Coman. Carlile is blunt about this, calling Bates "totally gay" and noting that the song was written by someone who loved the country despite not being allowed to fully participate in its legal or social benefits. This is the part that actually matters, it is the subtext that most of the 125 million viewers will miss, but Carlile sees it as her "moral imperative."

The song was written after Bates travelled to Pikes Peak in 1893, but the version Carlile is using dates back to the 1911 revision. When Carlile speaks about the lyrics, she isn't focusing on the "amber waves of grain." She is focusing on the parts that sound like a prayer for a better version of the country. Honestly, the choice to highlight "Confirm thy soul in self-control, thy liberty in law" feels like a direct jab at the political chaos of the mid-2020s. It is a call for order and restraint in a time when both are in short supply. Carlile acknowledges that the song is more about what America could be than what it currently is, which is a sophisticated way of being an activist without being a "neoliberal glossing over the problems."

## The Demographic Battle on the Field

The 2026 Super Bowl entertainment lineup is perhaps the most eclectic and, by extension, the most controversial in the history of the event. Between Carlile, the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, Coco Jones, and Charlie Puth, the NFL is leaning hard into a demographic reality that does not sit well with everyone. There is a segment of the population, often referred to as the MAGA movement, that has expressed enough vocal frustration with the "woke" direction of the halftime show that they are organising their own alternative viewing experiences. 

Carlile is aware of this. She mentions that the bill "looks exactly like America," including the players on the field and the people watching at home. This is not a coincidence. The NFL is a business that recognises where the money is going, and the money is moving toward a younger, more diverse, and more global audience. However, by placing a queer icon like Carlile in the pre-game slot to sing a song often mistaken for a second national anthem, the organisers are performing a delicate balancing act. They are trying to offer something to everyone while inadvertently highlighting the very divisions they hope to paper over.

## Singing at the Ceiling

Musically, Carlile is taking a risk that most vocalists would avoid on such a global stage. "The Star Spangled Banner" is notoriously difficult because of its wide intervals, but "America the Beautiful" is usually seen as the "easier" option. Carlile is rejecting that safety. By putting the song in a key that sits at the "ceiling" of her voice, she is ensuring that the performance feels strained, urgent, and raw. This isn't meant to be a smooth, comforting lullaby. It is meant to be a "powerhouse" moment that mirrors the "struggling people" she feels called to represent.

Working with SistaStrings, the duo of Monique and Chauntee Ross, adds another layer of intentionality. Their presence brings a soulful, string-heavy depth to the arrangement that moves away from the traditional brass-heavy patriotic sound. It is a folk-rock sensibility brought to the largest possible arena. Carlile is looking for "goodness" rather than "greatness," a distinction she makes to avoid the "patriarchal" connotations of the latter word. This linguistic choice is subtle but telling. It shows that even in her vocabulary, she is trying to deconstruct the traditional American mythos while still participating in its biggest ritual.

## The Problem with Being a Bridge

There is a legitimate question about whether Carlile can actually achieve what she wants. She admits that some of her most progressive fans might wonder if she should be participating in anything "patriotic" right now. The nation is troubled, the political climate is acidic, and the Super Bowl is the ultimate corporate machine. Can you really be an activist while being sponsored by Apple Music and performing for a league that has its own fraught history with social justice?

Carlile’s answer is personal. She says she has her own "moral code" and that her activism won't be found in the "comments section." This is a quiet way of saying she is tired of the "pit fights" of internet discourse. She believes that representation on this scale matters more than the purity of the platform. If a young queer kid in a rural town sees a woman like Brandi Carlile singing a patriotic song with pride and power, that is a victory that transcends the politics of the moment. Or at least, that is the hope.

## The Seahawks Factor

Surprisingly, the thing that makes this whole ordeal easier for Carlile is her hometown loyalty. She is a die-hard Seattle Seahawks fan. She joked that it’s easier to get involved in the Super Bowl when your team is involved, and while she isn't allowed to wear a jersey during the performance, she’ll have one on in her "heart." This touches on the one thing that still manages to unify people across the political divide: sports tribalism. 

It is a strange irony that the same person who is deeply contemplating the "fragile hope" of the American experiment is also just a fan who wants her team to win. This duality is perhaps the most human thing about her. She is a mother, a wife, a fan, and an activist, all wrapped into one. She is trying to navigate a world where everything is politicised, even the act of singing a 115-year-old song about mountains and grain.

## The Aspirational Struggle

The 1911 lyrics that Carlile is so fond of contain a verse that is rarely sung in public: "May God thy gold refine, till all success be nobleness, and every gain divine." This is the core of her argument. She is looking for a version of America where "success" isn't just about wealth or power, but about character. It is a lofty goal for a football game. 

As she prepares to step onto the field in San Francisco, Carlile is facing a reality where the country is more divided than it has been in decades. She is singing a song about "brotherhood from sea to shining sea" to a crowd that might be booing the halftime act or watching a different channel entirely. The "bombs bursting in air" that she promises will be musical, but the cultural explosions happening around the stadium are much harder to control.

She knows she won't relax until the first few shows of her arena tour are over, starting just two days later in Philadelphia. The Super Bowl is just one moment, a massive, terrifying, 125-million-viewer moment. But after the last note fades and the players take the field, the question remains whether a song can actually "mend every flaw" or if it simply provides a beautiful melody to mask the sound of the cracking.

The stadium lights are bright, the range is high, and the Seahawks are in the tunnel. Carlile is about to find out if "goodness" is enough to hold the room. As she steps to the microphone, the real question isn't whether she can hit the notes, but whether anyone is actually listening to the words she’s worked so hard to reclaim, or if they are just waiting for the coin toss to signal the start of a different kind of war.
