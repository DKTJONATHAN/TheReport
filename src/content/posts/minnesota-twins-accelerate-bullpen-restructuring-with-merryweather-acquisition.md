The Minnesota Twins have finalized a minor league contract with right-handed reliever Julian Merryweather, including an invitation to major league spring training. The move marks the latest phase in an aggressive restructuring of the club’s bullpen, which was significantly thinned following a trade deadline divestment last summer.

Merryweather, 34, joins the Twins as a non-roster invitee following a period of performance volatility. After a career-best 2023 campaign with the Chicago Cubs, where he posted a 3.38 ERA and 98 strikeouts across 72 innings, the veteran struggled with injuries and declining velocity. His combined performance across the 2024 and 2025 seasons resulted in a 6.15 ERA over 33.2 innings, leading to his eventual release and subsequent stints in the minor league systems of the New York Mets and Milwaukee Brewers.

The acquisition is part of a broader organizational strategy by the Twins to stabilize a relief unit that struggled during a 70-92 season. Following the mid-season trades of high-leverage arms Jhoan Duran, Griffin Jax, and Brock Stewart, the Minnesota front office has turned to the veteran market to fill substantial depth voids. Merryweather joins former All-Star Liam Hendriks and left-hander Anthony Banda as recent additions to the roster architecture.

Statistically, Merryweather remains an intriguing prospect for a reclamation project. Despite recent struggles, his arsenal features a fastball that consistently reaches the mid-90s and a slider that has historically been effective against right-handed hitters. Throughout his minor league career, he has maintained a 3.92 ERA with 426 strikeouts, suggesting a high ceiling if physical durability can be restored.

The current landscape of the Twins' bullpen offers a clear path for non-roster invitees. With only Taylor Rogers, Justin Topa, Cole Sands, and Kody Funderburk viewed as definitive locks for the Opening Day roster, the competition in Fort Myers is expected to be high. Merryweather will compete alongside other veteran depth signings, including Dan Altavilla, Matt Bowman, and Grant Hartwig.

From a management perspective, the deal represents a low-risk investment for a franchise in transition. If Merryweather can recapture the command and velocity showcased during his 2023 breakout, he provides the Twins with a cost-effective solution for middle-inning relief.

As the Twins navigate this period of fiscal and athletic recalibration, the focus remains on identifying undervalued assets in a volatile market.

The success of the Twins' 2026 season may well depend on whether these calculated risks in the pitching department yield a stable foundation for a return to American League Central competitiveness. Spring training will serve as the primary litmus test for Merryweather’s ability to reintegrate into a major league rotation.
