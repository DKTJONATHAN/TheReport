# THE SILENT FELONY: The Legal Architecture That Hunts Male Sex Workers for Sport

### **EXCLUSIVE: While female workers battle city bylaws, a loophole in the Penal Code has been weaponized to make the survival of male sex workers a guaranteed felony.**

**By Jonathan Mwaniki** *Special Investigation*

**NAIROBI** — It is an open secret in this city. By day, Nairobi is the pulse of East African business. By night, the neon lights of Westlands and the shadowed corridors of River Road conceal a thriving illicit trade. But beneath the surface of this nocturnal economy lies a stark, ignored legal reality.

While female sex workers navigate a complex system of county *askaris* and harassment for "loitering," their male counterparts face a different beast: a Penal Code weaponized to make their very existence a crime.

In this exclusive investigation, *The Mwaniki Report* dismantles the legal framework clause by clause, exposing a deliberate double standard. We reveal a system that doesn't just criminalize the act, but creates an inescapable trap for male sex workers, leaving them vulnerable to state-sanctioned extortion with absolutely no recourse.

### **Part I: The Gendered Trap**

Most Kenyans assume the law is blind. The text of the **Penal Code, Cap 63**, proves otherwise. When examined through the lens of gender, the primary legal weapon against sex workers reveals a disturbing pattern.

**THE TALE OF TWO SECTIONS**

| **Feature** | **Section 153 (Targets Male Sex Workers)** | **Section 154 (Targets Women)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Subject** | "Every **male person** who..." | "Every **woman** who..." |
| **The Crime** | "...knowingly lives wholly or in part on the earnings of prostitution." | "...knowingly lives wholly or in part on the earnings of prostitution." |
| **Severity** | **Felony** (Serious Crime) | **Misdemeanor** (Minor Offense) |
| **The Reality** | Interpreted literally to criminalize the male worker spending his *own* money. | Historically interpreted to target "Madams" or pimps controlling others. |
| **Penalty** | Prison sentences (up to 14 years for related acts) or high-value extortion. | Small fines (e.g., KSh 1,000), community service, or short holding. |

**The Legal Noose:** Section 153(1)(a) criminalizes the survival of the male sex worker. The moment a man uses money earned from sex work to pay rent, buy food, or board a *matatu*, he has committed a felony. He doesn't need to exploit anyone else; he is criminalized for supporting himself.

---

### **Part II: The Anatomy of the Trap**

The law is designed to ensure that a male sex worker is committing a crime at every single stage of his operation. There is no legal way to exist in this space.

* **TRAP 1: THE PROMOTION (Soliciting)**
    You cannot advertise. A website, a social media profile, or even standing on a street corner is a felony under **Section 153(b)**: *"Soliciting for Immoral Purposes."*
* **TRAP 2: THE ACT (Unnatural Offenses)**
    Unlike heterosexual sex work where the act itself is rarely the primary charge, for male sex workers, the sexual acts are classified as felonies under **Sections 162 and 165**, carrying sentences of up to **14 years**.
* **TRAP 3: THE LIVELIHOOD (Living on Earnings)**
    You cannot spend the money. The very act of surviving on your income is a felony under **Section 153(a)**.

This creates a "perfect storm" where police do not need to catch a man in the act; they only need evidence of his lifestyle to charge him with a serious crime.

### **Part III: Voices from the Shadows**

To understand the human cost, we spoke to male sex workers operating in Nairobi. Their names have been changed.

**"Kevin," 26 – The Westlands Freelancer**
Kevin turned to sex work through online apps after failing to find formal employment.
> "The police and the DCI know the law better than any lawyer," Kevin says, scanning the coffee shop nervously. "They don't want to arrest us; that's too much paperwork. They want M-Pesa."
>
> He recounts a recent setup: "I met a 'client' at a lodging in Ngara. It was a trap. Three men burst in. They quoted Section 153. They said, 'You are a male living on earnings of prostitution. That is 14 years.' They demanded KSh 50,000. I sent KSh 20,000. They left, laughing. We are not citizens to them; we are walking ATMs."

**"John," 32 – The CBD Veteran**
John contrasts his experience with the women he works alongside.
> "If one of the girls on Koinange gets picked up by the *kanjo*, it's a nuisance. They pay a KSh 1,000 fine for loitering. It's a business expense. For me? If I stand on that same corner, I am charged with a felony. If a client beats me, who do I call? If I walk into a police station bleeding, I become the criminal. The person who assaulted me goes free."

---

### **Part IV: The Constitutional Crisis**

This targeted criminalization flies in the face of the **Constitution of Kenya (2010)**.

* **Article 27(4):** *"The State shall not discriminate directly or indirectly against any person on any ground, including... sex."*
* **Article 28:** *"Every person has inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected."*

**THE HUMAN COST OF CRIMINALIZATION**

| **Impact Area** | **The Reality on the Ground** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Police Violence** | Male sex workers report significantly higher rates of physical assault by police than female workers. |
| **Blackmail** | The primary threat for over 70% of male workers is extortion by gangs posing as clients. |
| **Health Access** | Fear of arrest creates a barrier to HIV testing and treatment, driving up prevalence rates. |

### **The Verdict**

The hypocrisy is glaring. While society debates morality, the law has decided that gender determines the severity of the crime. For male sex workers in this trade, the danger is not just the dark alleyways; it is the black-and-white text of the Kenyan law. As long as Section 153 remains, they are not workers—they are walking felonies, waiting to be cashed in by a corrupt system.

# The Silent Felony: The Legal Architecture That Hunts Male Sex Workers for Sport

While female sex workers in Nairobi wrestle with county by-laws, *askaris*, and "loitering" charges, their male counterparts face something much darker: a Penal Code that turns their very survival into a **felony**.

This feature dissects that legal machinery and shows how it has been weaponised to make male sex workers walking crimes—always guilty, always exploitable.

***

## Part I: The Gendered Trap in the Penal Code

At the heart of this injustice lie two almost identical provisions in **Cap 63 – The Penal Code**: **Section 153** and **Section 154**.

On paper, both deal with people "living on the earnings of prostitution." In practice, they function very differently.

### The Tale of Two Sections

| Feature | Section 153 – Targets Men | Section 154 – Targets Women |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Wording | “Every **male person** who…” | “Every **woman** who…” |
| Core offence | Knowingly lives wholly or partly on the earnings of prostitution | Knowingly lives wholly or partly on the earnings of prostitution |
| Legal weight | **Felony** – serious crime | **Misdemeanor** – minor offence |
| Practical effect | Used to criminalise male sex workers for spending their own income | Historically aimed at madams/pimps who exploit others |
| Consequences | Long jail terms or crippling extortion | Small fines, brief detention, or release after plea |

### The Built-In Double Standard

Read literally, **Section 153(1)(a)** doesn’t just target pimps. It targets any *male person* who "lives on the earnings of prostitution."

That means:
- If a man pays his rent with sex work income → he’s a felon.  
- If he buys food, pays fare, or pays school fees → he’s a felon.  

A woman in the same line of work is more likely to be treated as a misdemeanour offender. A man is structurally coded as a serious criminal.

***

## Part II: The Anatomy of the Legal Trap

For male sex workers, every stage of their hustle is criminalised. There is **no legal route** through the system.

### Trap 1: The Promotion – “Soliciting for Immoral Purposes”

Any attempt to market services—standing on a corner, posting on an app, using coded language online—can be framed under provisions tied to **soliciting for immoral purposes**.

Police and undercover officers know how to use this:
- Fake clients
- Recorded chats
- Sting operations in lodgings

The "crime" is not violence or exploitation. It’s the mere act of signalling availability.

### Trap 2: The Act – “Unnatural Offences”

For many male sex workers, especially those serving male clients, the sexual act itself is criminalised under **Sections 162 and 165**:
- “Unnatural offences”
- “Gross indecency between males”

These carry **heavy penalties**—reportedly up to 14 years—completely disproportionate to consensual acts between adults.

### Trap 3: The Livelihood – “Living on the Earnings”

Even if the act and soliciting are never proven, **lifestyle becomes evidence**:
- A man suspected of sex work who cannot explain his income.
- M-Pesa statements showing repeated payments from “clients.”
- Being found in known hotspots.

Under Section 153, survival itself becomes the crime.

Police don’t have to prove exploitation. They just have to show:
> “You are a male person. You earn from prostitution. You live on that income.”

Felony established.

***

## Part III: Voices from the Shadows

### “Kevin”, 26 – Westlands

> “They don’t want to take you to court. Court is work. They want your M‑Pesa.”

Kevin explains how a "client" booked him through an app and lured him to a Ngara lodging.

> “Three men burst in. They quoted Section 153 like they are judges. ‘You are a male living on earnings of prostitution. That’s 14 years.’ They demanded 50k. I sent 20k. They laughed and walked out.”

For Kevin, the law is not a book; it’s a weapon pointed at his SIM card.

### “John”, 32 – CBD

> “When *kanjo* pick up the girls on Koinange, it’s a nuisance. They pay a fine, they are back. For me, if I go to report a client who beat me, I become the criminal.”

He has scars from a beating by a violent client. He never reported.

> “If I walk into a station bleeding, they’ll ask where I was, who I was with, what I do. By the time I finish, I’ll be in the cell. The man who attacked me will go home.”

***

## Part IV: A Constitutional Time Bomb

Kenya’s **2010 Constitution** looks very different from these Penal Code relics.

### What the Constitution Says

- **Article 27(4):** The State shall not discriminate on any ground, including *sex*.  
- **Article 28:** Every person has inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected.  

Yet male sex workers are:
- Punished more harshly than women for the same economic activity.  
- Denied meaningful access to justice and protection.  
- Exposed to violence and extortion because reporting crime exposes them to prosecution.

### The Human Cost

| Impact Area | Reality for Male Sex Workers |
| :--- | :--- |
| Police violence | Beatings, forced strip-searches, and threats of "evidence photos" shared with family |
| Extortion | Demands for cash or sex by police and fake clients using Penal Code threats |
| Health access | Fear of arrest at clinics or outreach programs; avoidance of HIV/STI services |
| Mental health | Chronic anxiety, depression, and isolation due to constant criminalisation |

***

## The Verdict: Walking Felonies in a Broken System

For male sex workers in Kenya, the greatest danger is not only the streets, clients, or disease. It is the **law itself**.

As long as provisions like **Section 153** remain, the State has written them into existence as **permanent suspects**:
- Always guilty if they work.  
- Always guilty if they eat from that work.  
- Always exploitable by anyone who can quote the law.

This is not justice. It is a **silent felony** built into the architecture of Kenyan law—a system that hunts a specific class of citizen for sport, while pretending to defend morality.
