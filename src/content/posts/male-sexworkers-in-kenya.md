# The Silent Felony: The Legal Architecture That Hunts Male Sex Workers for Sport

While female sex workers in Nairobi wrestle with county by-laws, *askaris*, and "loitering" charges, their male counterparts face something much darker: a Penal Code that turns their very survival into a **felony**.

This feature dissects that legal machinery and shows how it has been weaponised to make male sex workers walking crimes—always guilty, always exploitable.

***

## Part I: The Gendered Trap in the Penal Code

At the heart of this injustice lie two almost identical provisions in **Cap 63 – The Penal Code**: **Section 153** and **Section 154**.

On paper, both deal with people "living on the earnings of prostitution." In practice, they function very differently.

### The Tale of Two Sections

| Feature | Section 153 – Targets Men | Section 154 – Targets Women |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Wording | “Every **male person** who…” | “Every **woman** who…” |
| Core offence | Knowingly lives wholly or partly on the earnings of prostitution | Knowingly lives wholly or partly on the earnings of prostitution |
| Legal weight | **Felony** – serious crime | **Misdemeanor** – minor offence |
| Practical effect | Used to criminalise male sex workers for spending their own income | Historically aimed at madams/pimps who exploit others |
| Consequences | Long jail terms or crippling extortion | Small fines, brief detention, or release after plea |

### The Built-In Double Standard

Read literally, **Section 153(1)(a)** doesn’t just target pimps. It targets any *male person* who "lives on the earnings of prostitution."

That means:
- If a man pays his rent with sex work income → he’s a felon.  
- If he buys food, pays fare, or pays school fees → he’s a felon.  

A woman in the same line of work is more likely to be treated as a misdemeanour offender. A man is structurally coded as a serious criminal.

## Part II: The Anatomy of the Legal Trap

For male sex workers, every stage of their hustle is criminalised. There is **no legal route** through the system.

### Trap 1: The Promotion – “Soliciting for Immoral Purposes”

Any attempt to market services—standing on a corner, posting on an app, using coded language online—can be framed under provisions tied to **soliciting for immoral purposes**.

Police and undercover officers know how to use this:
- Fake clients
- Recorded chats
- Sting operations in lodgings

The "crime" is not violence or exploitation. It’s the mere act of signalling availability.

### Trap 2: The Act – “Unnatural Offences”

For many male sex workers, especially those serving male clients, the sexual act itself is criminalised under **Sections 162 and 165**:
- “Unnatural offences”
- “Gross indecency between males”

These carry **heavy penalties**—reportedly up to 14 years—completely disproportionate to consensual acts between adults.

### Trap 3: The Livelihood – “Living on the Earnings”

Even if the act and soliciting are never proven, **lifestyle becomes evidence**:
- A man suspected of sex work who cannot explain his income.
- M-Pesa statements showing repeated payments from “clients.”
- Being found in known hotspots.

Under Section 153, survival itself becomes the crime.

Police don’t have to prove exploitation. They just have to show:
> “You are a male person. You earn from prostitution. You live on that income.”

Felony established.

## Part III: Voices from the Shadows

### “Kevin”, 26 – Westlands

> “They don’t want to take you to court. Court is work. They want your M‑Pesa.”

Kevin explains how a "client" booked him through an app and lured him to a Ngara lodging.

> “Three men burst in. They quoted Section 153 like they are judges. ‘You are a male living on earnings of prostitution. That’s 14 years.’ They demanded 50k. I sent 20k. They laughed and walked out.”

For Kevin, the law is not a book; it’s a weapon pointed at his SIM card.

### “John”, 32 – CBD

> “When *kanjo* pick up the girls on Koinange, it’s a nuisance. They pay a fine, they are back. For me, if I go to report a client who beat me, I become the criminal.”

He has scars from a beating by a violent client. He never reported.

> “If I walk into a station bleeding, they’ll ask where I was, who I was with, what I do. By the time I finish, I’ll be in the cell. The man who attacked me will go home.”

***

## Part IV: A Constitutional Time Bomb

Kenya’s **2010 Constitution** looks very different from these Penal Code relics.

### What the Constitution Says

- **Article 27(4):** The State shall not discriminate on any ground, including *sex*.  
- **Article 28:** Every person has inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected.  

Yet male sex workers are:
- Punished more harshly than women for the same economic activity.  
- Denied meaningful access to justice and protection.  
- Exposed to violence and extortion because reporting crime exposes them to prosecution.

### The Human Cost

| Impact Area | Reality for Male Sex Workers |
| :--- | :--- |
| Police violence | Beatings, forced strip-searches, and threats of "evidence photos" shared with family |
| Extortion | Demands for cash or sex by police and fake clients using Penal Code threats |
| Health access | Fear of arrest at clinics or outreach programs; avoidance of HIV/STI services |
| Mental health | Chronic anxiety, depression, and isolation due to constant criminalisation |

## The Verdict: Walking Felonies in a Broken System

For male sex workers in Kenya, the greatest danger is not only the streets, clients, or disease. It is the **law itself**.

As long as provisions like **Section 153** remain, the State has written them into existence as **permanent suspects**:
- Always guilty if they work.  
- Always guilty if they eat from that work.  
- Always exploitable by anyone who can quote the law.

This is not justice. It is a **silent felony** built into the architecture of Kenyan law—a system that hunts a specific class of citizen for sport, while pretending to defend morality.
