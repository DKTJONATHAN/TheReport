# Opposition Leaders Demand Recall of Kenyan Youth from Russia

## Background on the Nyandarua Meeting and Allegations

Leaders of the United Opposition convened in Nyandarua County on Sunday to address a series of national concerns, primarily focusing on the welfare of Kenyan citizens abroad and the state of the domestic education system. During a church service, the political figures, including DCP party leader Rigathi Gachagua, DP party leader Justin Muturi, and Jubilee Deputy Party Leader Fred Matiang'i, issued a collective statement regarding the government's foreign employment programmes. The primary focus of the address was the allegation that young Kenyans, who were initially promised employment opportunities in foreign nations, have been diverted into active military zones within Russia.

The opposition leaders stated that the government has a fundamental responsibility to ensure the safety of its citizens when facilitating bilateral labour agreements. They alleged that the current administration has misled the youth by offering promises of overseas jobs that have resulted in individuals being placed in high-risk environments. The leaders expressed that the lack of transparency in these recruitment processes has left many families in a state of uncertainty regarding the whereabouts and safety of their relatives. This meeting in Nyandarua served as the starting point for a series of public engagements intended to highlight what the opposition describes as systemic failures in the current administration's handling of both foreign and domestic policy.

## Allegations Regarding Military Involvement in Russia

DCP party leader Rigathi Gachagua provided specific details regarding the concerns surrounding Kenyan youth in Russia. He urged President William Ruto to take immediate executive action to intervene in the matter. According to Gachagua, there are reports indicating that several young Kenyans have lost their lives while present in conflict zones. He argued that the government’s duty of care was breached when these individuals were exposed to war zones under the pretext of legitimate employment schemes. The DCP leader called for an immediate and comprehensive recall of all Kenyan youths currently in Russia who were sent through these government-linked programmes.

The call for a recall was supported by DP party leader Justin Muturi, who questioned the accountability mechanisms governing the recruitment of Kenyans for foreign markets. Muturi noted that the recruitment process appeared to lack the necessary oversight to protect vulnerable job seekers from being exploited or placed in harm's way. He emphasised that the safety and welfare of Kenyan citizens must take precedence over any diplomatic or economic arrangements. The opposition leaders collectively demanded a full disclosure of the number of Kenyans currently in Russia, the nature of their employment contracts, and the specific locations where they are stationed. They argued that without such transparency, the government remains complicit in the risks faced by these citizens.

## Challenges in the Education Sector and CBC Transition

Separately from the issues of foreign employment, Jubilee Deputy Party Leader Fred Matiang'i addressed the ongoing transition within the Kenyan education system. He specifically criticised the government’s communication regarding the enrollment of Grade 10 students under the Competency-Based Curriculum, also known as the CBC. Matiang'i noted that the recent announcements from the Ministry of Education have been unclear, leading to a situation where a significant number of students have not yet resumed their secondary school education. He stated that the lack of a coherent plan for the transition to Grade 10 has placed the academic future of many learners at risk.

Matiang'i further accused the administration of politicising the education sector, suggesting that policy decisions are being made without adequate preparation or consideration for the practicalities of school infrastructure and teacher readiness. He argued that the transition to the next phase of the CBC requires more than just administrative directives, it requires a clear roadmap that ensures all students have equitable access to learning materials and facilities. Justin Muturi echoed these sentiments, stressing that the education sector is in need of comprehensive and serious reforms. Muturi highlighted that the current state of the transition has created confusion among parents and educators alike, and he called for a more structured approach to ensure that no student is left behind during the implementation of the new curriculum.

## Changes to Teacher Recruitment Protocols

The opposition also directed criticism toward the President regarding changes in the recruitment of teachers. Fred Matiang'i highlighted a shift in the responsibility for hiring educators, noting that the task has reportedly been moved from the Teachers Service Commission, an independent constitutional body, to the State House. Matiang'i described this move as a departure from established institutional frameworks and argued that it could lead to unfair practices. He expressed concern that moving recruitment to a political office could result in discriminatory hiring, where individuals perceived as not supporting the current administration might be disadvantaged.

The Teachers Service Commission has traditionally held the mandate to manage the affairs of teachers in Kenya, including recruitment, deployment, and discipline. The opposition leaders argued that bypassing this commission undermines the independence of the teaching profession and introduces political patronage into the civil service. They called for the recruitment process to be returned to the commission to ensure that hiring is based on merit and professional standards rather than political affiliation. This change in protocol, according to the opposition, represents a broader trend of centralising power and weakening independent institutions that are meant to serve the public interest without bias.

## The Opposition's Proposed Governance Strategy

In response to the issues raised, the United Opposition leaders outlined their own strategy for the country, which they described as a transformative agenda. They rejected the notion that they lack a clear plan for governance, insisting that they have developed a comprehensive strategy focused on restoring good governance and improving the welfare of all Kenyans. A central pillar of this proposed agenda is the reintroduction of free primary and secondary education. The leaders argued that making education fully free and accessible is essential for the country’s long-term development and for reducing the burden on struggling families.

The opposition vowed to reverse the policies of the current administration that they believe have failed the public. They stated that their focus would be on creating a government that is accountable to its citizens and transparent in its operations. This includes a commitment to safeguarding the rights of workers both at home and abroad, ensuring that labour export programmes are conducted ethically and safely. The leaders emphasised that their agenda is built on the principle of equity, aiming to ensure that government services and opportunities are distributed fairly across all regions and communities, regardless of their political leanings.

## Public Engagements in Nakuru and Nyandarua

Following the church service in Nyandarua, the opposition leaders held a series of public engagements in both Nyandarua and Nakuru counties. These events were designed to allow the leaders to interact directly with residents and further explain their positions on the issues of the day. During these rallies, the leaders reiterated their concerns regarding the youth in Russia and the state of the education system. They encouraged the public to remain vigilant and to demand better services and more transparency from their elected officials.

The engagements in Nakuru and Nyandarua were attended by various local leaders and residents who expressed their own concerns regarding the high cost of living and the lack of employment opportunities for the youth. The opposition leaders used these platforms to reinforce their commitment to a new direction for the country, promising to continue their oversight role and to hold the government accountable for its actions. They stated that the public engagements are part of a broader effort to mobilise support for their transformative agenda and to ensure that the voices of ordinary Kenyans are heard in the national political discourse.

## Next Steps and Future Outlook

The United Opposition has indicated that they will continue to monitor the situation regarding the Kenyan youth in Russia and will persist in their demands for a formal recall. They have called for a parliamentary inquiry into the recruitment processes for overseas jobs to determine how citizens ended up in conflict zones. Furthermore, the leaders stated that they would continue to advocate for reforms in the education sector, specifically seeking clarity on the Grade 10 transition and the restoration of the Teachers Service Commission's full recruitment powers.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the opposition leaders have signalled their intention to expand their public engagements to other parts of the country. They aim to build a broad-based coalition that can challenge the current administration's policies and offer an alternative vision for Kenya's future. The focus remains on issues of governance, economic welfare, and the protection of constitutional institutions. The government has yet to issue a detailed response to the specific allegations regarding the military zones in Russia or the criticisms of the teacher recruitment process, and the opposition has stated that they will not relent until these matters are addressed with the seriousness they deserve. Details regarding the exact number of affected youths and the specific nature of the government's next steps in the education sector remain unclear as the public awaits further official communication.
