# Six suspects apprehended in Kilifi following violent robbery and burglary in Mtwapa


Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, commonly referred to as the DCI, have successfully apprehended six suspects believed to be involved in a significant violent robbery and burglary incident. The incident in question was reported in the Mtwapa area on 28 January 2026. Following a period of intensive intelligence gathering and tracking, the suspects were located and taken into custody in Vipingo, which is situated within the Kilifi South Sub-County. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations confirmed that the operation was launched after receiving credible information that the individuals had sought refuge in the area to evade police capture following the initial crime.

The operation was conducted with precision by officers who had been monitoring the movements of the group. According to the DCI, the first phase of the arrests took place at a specific residence in Vipingo. During this initial raid, three primary suspects were identified and detained. These individuals have been named as Mustafa Majeza Juma, Bubbline Kitsao Kazungu, and Abdul Mwatondo Matano. The residence where they were found was subjected to a thorough search by the investigating officers to identify any items that could link the suspects to the reported robbery or other criminal activities in the coastal region.

During the search of the first premises, investigators recovered a variety of items that are now being treated as evidence. These items included six mobile phones and eight national identity cards. Notably, the national identity cards bore different names, a discovery that has prompted further investigation into whether the suspects were involved in identity theft or if the documents belong to previous victims of crime. In addition to the electronic devices and identification documents, the police also recovered weapons. Specifically, two Somali swords and two pangas were found on the property. These items are frequently associated with violent crimes in the region and will be subjected to forensic analysis.

A significant piece of evidence recovered at the first location was a cash bail receipt issued in the name of Mustafa Majeza Juma. Upon further verification by the investigators, it was revealed that this receipt is directly linked to a separate and ongoing legal matter. The DCI stated that the receipt pertains to an earlier case involving an attempted robbery with violence. Furthermore, it was discovered that Mustafa Majeza Juma had an outstanding warrant of arrest against him in relation to that previous case. This suggests a pattern of alleged criminal behaviour and highlights the importance of the current apprehension in addressing long standing judicial requirements.

The investigation did not conclude with the first three arrests. Police reports indicate that the three suspects who were initially detained cooperated with the detectives and provided information regarding the whereabouts of their associates. This information led the officers to a second hideout within the same general vicinity. At this second location, the police successfully arrested three additional individuals. These suspects have been identified as Swale Mwarauka, Mohammed Juma, and Hamisi Rama. The discovery of a second hideout suggests an organised effort by the group to distribute their presence and potentially conceal their activities across multiple locations.

The search of the second hideout yielded further incriminating evidence. Officers recovered eighteen large rolls of cannabis sativa, a substance that is prohibited under Kenyan law. Along with the narcotics, a weighing scale was found, which investigators believe was used for the distribution of the illegal substance. Additionally, the police seized 7,000 Kenyan Shillings in cash. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has stated that this money is believed to be proceeds of crime, potentially linked to either the robbery in Mtwapa or the sale of the recovered narcotics. The presence of both weapons and drugs at the scenes indicates a multifaceted criminal operation that the DCI is now working to dismantle.

Following the successful arrests and the recovery of the various items, all six suspects were transported to the Mtwapa Police Station. This facility will serve as the primary holding point as the legal process moves forward. To ensure that a comprehensive investigation is conducted, detectives sought and obtained custodial orders from the court. These orders allow the police to hold the suspects for a period of fourteen days. This window of time is considered essential for the completion of several investigative tasks, including the forensic examination of the recovered mobile phones and the verification of the eight national identity cards.

The fourteen day period will also allow the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to conduct identification parades. During these parades, victims of the robbery that occurred on 28 January 2026, as well as victims of other recent crimes in the Mtwapa and Kilifi South areas, may be called upon to identify the suspects. This is a standard procedural step in the Kenyan judicial system to ensure that the evidence presented in court is robust and that the correct individuals are held accountable for specific acts of violence. The DCI has emphasised that the investigation is ongoing and that they are looking into the possibility that this group may be linked to a wider network of criminals operating along the coast.

The recovery of the Somali swords and pangas is of particular concern to the local authorities. These weapons are often used to intimidate and harm civilians during burglaries and street robberies. By removing these weapons from circulation and apprehending the individuals alleged to have used them, the police aim to improve the overall security situation in Kilifi County. The coastal region, which is a hub for tourism and commerce, relies heavily on a stable and safe environment. The DCI has reiterated its commitment to pursuing those who disrupt the peace and safety of the residents in these areas.

The involvement of narcotics in this case adds another layer to the legal challenges facing the six suspects. In Kenya, the possession and distribution of cannabis sativa carry significant legal penalties. The discovery of the weighing scale and the cash suggests that the suspects may have been involved in the local drug trade, which often intersects with violent crime. The investigators are working to determine the source of the cannabis and whether the suspects are part of a larger trafficking ring. The 7,000 Kenyan Shillings seized will be held as an exhibit and may eventually be forfeited to the state if it is proven to be the result of illegal transactions.

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has praised the role of intelligence in this operation. The ability to track the suspects from the scene of the crime in Mtwapa to their hideouts in Vipingo demonstrates the effectiveness of modern policing techniques and the importance of community cooperation. The DCI often relies on tips from the public and undercover surveillance to monitor criminal elements. In this instance, the intelligence provided was accurate enough to lead to the recovery of stolen property, weapons, and illegal drugs, while also bringing six individuals into custody.

As the fourteen day custodial period progresses, the suspects will remain at the Mtwapa Police Station. Their eventual arraignment in court will depend on the findings of the detectives during this time. The charges are expected to include robbery with violence, burglary, possession of prohibited weapons, and possession of narcotics. Robbery with violence is a capital offence under the Kenyan Penal Code, reflecting the seriousness with which the state views crimes that involve the use of weapons and the threat of physical harm to citizens.

The case has drawn attention to the security dynamics of Kilifi South Sub-County. Mtwapa is known for its vibrant nightlife and dense population, which can sometimes present challenges for law enforcement. Vipingo, while more rural and industrial in parts, has also seen developments that require consistent police presence. The movement of suspects between these two areas highlights the mobility of criminal groups and the need for coordinated efforts between different police stations and units within the county.

In summary, the arrest of Mustafa Majeza Juma, Bubbline Kitsao Kazungu, Abdul Mwatondo Matano, Swale Mwarauka, Mohammed Juma, and Hamisi Rama marks a significant step in the investigation into the events of 28 January 2026. The recovery of six mobile phones, eight identity cards, various weapons, and narcotics provides a substantial amount of evidence for the prosecution to consider. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations continues to process the evidence and prepare the case for the suspects' upcoming appearance in court. The public is encouraged to remain vigilant and to continue supporting law enforcement efforts to maintain safety and order within the community. The DCI has assured the residents of Mtwapa and the wider Kilifi County that they will continue to act on intelligence to ensure that all individuals involved in violent crime are brought to justice.
