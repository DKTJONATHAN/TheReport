## The Myth of the "Mother" is Dead

Let us stop pretending. The narrative that Tanzania witnessed a sudden "spasm" of violence after the October 2025 election is a lie. It is a comfortable fiction sold to the international community to hide a much darker truth.

The massacre did not begin when the polls closed. It began months before, in the shadows.

What we are witnessing in Tanzania is not just a stolen election; it is the calculated, systematic consolidation of a dictatorship. President **Samia Suluhu Hassan**, once hailed as a reformer, has unmasked herself as a tyrant who has surpassed even the darkest days of her predecessors. She used her gender and her soft-spoken "4Rs" (Reconciliation, Resilience, Reforms, and Rebuilding) as a smokescreen while her death squads hunted down the youth of Tanzania.

### 1\. The Prelude to Slaughter: The "Disappeared" (2024-2025)

The killings didn't start with protests. They started with silence. Long before the first ballot was cast, a terrifying pattern of "abduction and erasure" was established.

  * **The Acid Murder (September 2024):** The world ignored the warning sign of **Ali Mohamed Kibao**. A senior Chadema official, he was dragged off a bus by armed men. He wasn't just killed; he was tortured, beaten, and had **acid poured on his face** before being dumped. This was a message: *Opposition will be disfigured.*
  * **The Missing Youth (August 2024 - Present):** Where are **Deusdedith Soka**, **Jacob Godwin Mlay**, and **Frank Mbise**? These young activists were bundled into cars by "unidentified men" over a year ago. They haven't been seen since.
  * **The List grows:** **Dioniz Kipanya** (missing since July 2024) and **Humphrey Polepole** (a former diplomat and critic whose home was found splattered with blood in October 2025).

These were not arrests. These were state-sanctioned kidnappings designed to decapitate the opposition movement before it could even organize.

## The "Abduction Squad" and The Family Business

We are not dealing with rogue police officers. We are dealing with a dedicated **"Task Force."**

Intelligence reports and opposition leaks have identified a shadowy paramilitary unit—an "abduction squad"—operating outside the standard chain of command. Chillingly, allegations have surfaced linking the command of these operations to the President's own inner circle, with specific accusations pointing toward her son, **Abdul Hafidh Ameir**, as a key figure in the security apparatus coordinating these "neutralizations."

They drive unmarked white Land Cruisers. They do not carry warrants; they carry body bags. Their mandate was clear: **Clear the board before the election.**

### The "Sham" Election: 97.66%

On October 29, 2025, the farce was completed.

  * **The Dictator's Margin:** Samia was declared the winner with **97.66%** of the vote. In the 21st century, such a number is not a victory; it is an insult to intelligence.
  * **The Disqualification:** She didn't beat the opposition; she banned them. **Tundu Lissu** was arrested on treason charges. **Luhaga Mpina** was disqualified. The ballot paper was effectively a single-choice questionnaire.
  * **SADC's Rare Rebuke:** Even the Southern African Development Community (SADC), usually a club of dictator-apologists, could not stomach it. They called the election a **"sham"** and noted that their observers witnessed ballot boxes being stuffed while voters stayed home in fear.

## The "As a Mother" Betrayal

Perhaps the most sickening moment came after the massacre began. As bodies piled up in the morgues of Dar es Salaam, President Samia stood before the cameras. She did not mourn. She did not apologize.

She said she had **"forgiven"** the protesters **"as a mother,"** dismissing their rage as "peer pressure."

While she spoke of motherly forgiveness, her forces were entering **Muhimbili National Hospital** to remove the bodies of those they had shot, loading them onto trucks to be buried in mass graves—likely near the **Katavi National Park**, where other victims have been found in the past. They stole the dead to hide the count.

## The Verdict

Tanzania is no longer a democracy. It is a crime scene.

The "Royal Tour" documentary showed you the beauty of the Serengeti. It didn't show you the torture chambers in Oyster Bay. The world must wake up. Suluhu is not a reformer. She is a dictator who walked to the throne over the bodies of her own people.

**The massacre was not an event. It was a policy.**
