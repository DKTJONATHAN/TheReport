# The Myth of the "Mother" is Dead

Let’s stop pretending. The idea that Tanzania witnessed a sudden "spasm" of violence after the October 2025 election is a lie—a fiction sold to the world to hide a darker reality.

The murders did not begin with the protests; they began months before, in silence.

What unfolded in Tanzania was not just a stolen election—it was the calculated consolidation of a dictatorship. President **Samia Suluhu Hassan**, once celebrated as a reformer, unmasked herself as a tyrant. She used her gender and the soft-spoken "4Rs" (Reconciliation, Resilience, Reforms, and Rebuilding) as a smokescreen while her death squads hunted youth and opposition.

## 1. The Prelude to Slaughter: The "Disappeared" (2024-2025)

The killing started with silence. Before the first ballot, Tanzania witnessed an "abduction and erasure" strategy.

- **The Acid Murder (September 2024):** The case of **Ali Mohamed Kibao**, Chadema official, dragged off a bus, tortured, beaten, and had acid poured on his face before being dumped. A message: *Opposition will be disfigured.*
- **The Missing Youth (August 2024 - Present):** Where are **Deusdedith Soka**, **Jacob Godwin Mlay**, and **Frank Mbise**? Snatched by unidentified men, they haven’t been seen since.
- **The List continues:** **Dioniz Kipanya** (missing since July 2024), **Humphrey Polepole** (former diplomat and critic, whose home was found splattered with blood in October 2025).

These weren’t arrests. These were state-sanctioned kidnappings—to decapitate opposition before it could organize.

## The "Abduction Squad" and The Family Business

This is more than rogue officers—it’s a dedicated **"Task Force"**.

Intelligence leaks point to a paramilitary unit operating outside official command, with allegations pointing to President Suluhu’s son, **Abdul Hafidh Ameir**, coordinating these "neutralizations."

The squad moves in unmarked white Land Cruisers, never with warrants, always with body bags. Their order: **Clear the board before the election.**

## The "Sham" Election: 97.66%

- **The Dictator’s Margin:** Samia declared winner with **97.66%**—numbers that insult intelligence.
- **Opposition erased:** **Tundu Lissu** arrested for treason; **Luhaga Mpina** disqualified. Voters given one choice.
- **SADC’s rare rebuke:** Even the usually silent Southern African Development Community labeled it a **"sham"**, observing ballot boxes stuffed while voters hid in fear.

## The "As a Mother" Betrayal

The massacre continued, bodies stacked in Dar es Salaam’s morgues, while President Samia dismissed outrage as "peer pressure." She claimed to "forgive" protesters *"as a mother"* even as her forces entered hospitals, removed bodies, and loaded them into mass graves—likely near **Katavi National Park**.

## The Verdict

Tanzania is no longer a democracy—it is a crime scene.

The "Royal Tour" sold the beauty of Serengeti but hid the torture chambers of Oyster Bay. Suluhu isn’t a reformer. She’s a dictator who climbed the throne atop the bones of her own people.

**This wasn’t an event. It was a policy.**
