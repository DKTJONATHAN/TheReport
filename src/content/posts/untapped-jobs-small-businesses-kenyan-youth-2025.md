# Tackling Joblessness: New Small Business Ideas for Kenyan Youth

Kenya faces a growing crisis of youth unemployment in 2025. As the crime rate rises, many young people struggle to find income opportunities. You don't have to wait for government changes. You can start small businesses and jobs that need little to no formal skills or certificates, but fill meaningful gaps in the market.

This article highlights **10 untapped jobs and small business ideas** you can start now. Each comes with clear startup costs and practical details so you can dive in confidently and create steady income.

## 1. Waste Collection and Recycling Business

Kenya struggles with waste management, especially in urban and peri-urban areas. Starting a waste collection and recycling service creates real value by improving public health and the environment. You collect recyclable plastics, metals, and organic waste—organics can be composted and sold to farmers.

- **Startup Capital:** 25,000–40,000 KES for gloves, bags, wheelbarrows, and transport (bicycle/motorbike).
- **Why It Works:** Many neighborhoods lack reliable waste services. You provide convenience and improve hygiene.
- **Growth Tip:** Partner with recycling firms or sell compost locally.

## 2. Water Vending and Refilling Stations

Access to clean water remains limited in many areas. Purifying and vending clean water can solve this. Use affordable filters like ceramic or sand-based systems to keep costs low.

- **Startup Capital:** 40,000–70,000 KES for water tanks, filters, containers, and licensing.
- **Tip:** Offer delivery services using a bicycle or motorbike to widen your client base.

## 3. Street and Mobile Car Wash Services

Vehicle owners and boda boda riders want convenient, low-cost washing options. Offer mobile car wash services near busy spots or door-to-door.

- **Startup Capital:** About 20,000 KES for buckets, water, soap, and sponges.
- **Extra Income:** Add interior cleaning or waxing as you grow.

## 4. Airtime and Data Reselling (Mini ISP Model)

Many Kenyans struggle to buy small amounts of airtime and data conveniently. Become a reseller using platforms like Safaricom’s Lipa Na M-Pesa or specialized apps. Also, consider small WiFi reselling by setting up hotspots in crowded neighborhoods or student hostels.

- **Startup Capital:** 10,000–30,000 KES for registration, a smartphone, and an initial stock of bundles.
- **Expansion:** Sell WiFi access at a profit to renters or small shops.

## 5. Urban and Herbal Plant Nursery

More people want fresh organic produce and herbal remedies. Grow fast-maturing herbs like moringa, aloe vera, and local vegetables in small urban spaces.

- **Startup Capital:** 15,000–25,000 KES for seeds, pots, soil, and simple tools.
- **Market:** Sell to hawkers, restaurants, and health-focused shops.

***

## 6. Motorcycle Spare Parts Kiosk

The boda boda industry grows daily but lacks affordable parts in many suburbs. Selling brake pads, tires, lights, and other essentials fills a steady need.

- **Startup Capital:** 50,000–80,000 KES for initial stock and a kiosk space.
- **Tip:** Build strong supplier relationships for better prices.

***
