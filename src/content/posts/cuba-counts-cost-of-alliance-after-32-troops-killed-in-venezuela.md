The Cuban Revolution is currently choking on its own rhetoric. The arrival of 32 coffins at Havana’s airport isn't just a national tragedy; it is a clinical demonstration of strategic overreach and the total collapse of the Havana-Caracas axis. By forced admission, the Cuban government has finally confirmed what the world already knew: their "medical missions" were a front for a deep-state intelligence apparatus designed to keep a failing Venezuelan regime on life support.

The "honour and glory" bestowed upon the fallen cannot mask the humiliating reality of the situation. These 32 intelligence and military assets were neutralized by a superior US force that suffered virtually no losses. While 88-year-old revolutionary relics like Victor Dreke evoke the ghost of the 1961 Bay of Pigs, they are ignoring the surgical reality of modern warfare. Delta Force doesn’t fight like the CIA of the sixties, and a civilian population receiving "weapons training" in a country without electricity or food is not a "hornets' nest", it is a humanitarian disaster waiting to happen.

From a realist perspective, Cuba’s survival strategy has been decapitated. For two decades, the island traded ideological muscle and repressive expertise for Venezuelan oil. That trade is over. The most cynical blow to the Castro-Canel administration isn't the deaths themselves, but the rapid pivot of Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez. Her "modus vivendi" with the Trump administration proves that in the game of global power, ideological "brotherhood" is a currency that devalues the moment the bullets start flying. 

Havana is now staring into a void. The economy is not merely "limping"; it is in a state of necrotic failure. Tourism is dead, fuel is a luxury, and the blackouts are a permanent feature of a crumbling infrastructure. Without the Venezuelan umbilical cord, the Cuban government has nothing to offer its people but funeral processions and nostalgia. The "original generation" may be ready to die in a ditch for a 1950s dream, but the soldiers they sent to die in Caracas have already proven that the dream has no tactical or economic viability in the 21st century.

Washington’s insistence that the "days are numbered" for the Cuban Revolution feels less like a threat and more like a mathematical certainty. When your only defense against a superpower is a handful of aging commanders shouting at the sky while your primary ally negotiates with your enemy, you aren't a revolutionary power, you are a relic waiting for the final lights to go out.
