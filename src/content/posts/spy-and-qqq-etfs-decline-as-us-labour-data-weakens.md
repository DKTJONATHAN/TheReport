# SPY and QQQ ETFs Decline as US Labour Data Weakens

## Background of the February 2026 Market Environment

On Thursday, 5 February 2026, the United States equity markets experienced a notable downturn, characterised by a sharp decline in two of the most widely tracked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) both concluded the trading session with losses exceeding 1%. This market movement occurred against a backdrop of heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators, particularly those relating to the health of the national labour market and the subsequent policy responses of the Federal Reserve.

Throughout the early weeks of 2026, investors remained focused on the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maintaining price stability and promoting maximum employment. Following a period of restrictive monetary policy aimed at curbing inflationary pressures, the focus of the financial community shifted toward the potential for a transition to a more accommodative stance. The performance of the SPY, which tracks a broad index of 500 large-cap US companies, and the QQQ, which is heavily weighted toward the technology and growth sectors, serves as a primary barometer for investor sentiment regarding economic growth and interest rate trajectories.

The decline observed on 5 February was not an isolated event but rather a reaction to a specific set of data points that suggested a cooling in the employment sector. In the months leading up to this report, the US economy had shown signs of resilience, yet the sudden influx of weak labour data on a single day triggered a reassessment of the risk of an economic slowdown. According to reports from TipRanks, the market's reaction was a direct consequence of investors digesting these fresh data points, which collectively pointed toward a softening in the demand for labour and an increase in unemployment claims (TipRanks, 2026).

## Key Developments: The Trio of Weak Labour Indicators

The primary catalyst for the market volatility on 5 February 2026 was the simultaneous release of three distinct reports concerning the US labour market. These reports, often referred to as a "trio" of data, provided a comprehensive, albeit discouraging, view of employment trends. The convergence of these negative indicators led to an immediate repricing of assets as the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut surged.

The first component of this data trio involved the weekly initial jobless claims. The figures released by the Department of Labour indicated a higher-than-anticipated number of individuals filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. This metric is frequently used by economists as a real-time indicator of the pace of layoffs across the country. When initial claims rise unexpectedly, it often signals that businesses are reducing their workforces in response to declining demand or rising operational costs.

The second data point involved continuing jobless claims, which track the number of people who remain on unemployment benefits after their initial filing. The 5 February report showed a persistent increase in this figure, suggesting that displaced workers are finding it increasingly difficult to secure new employment. This lack of labour market fluidity is a key concern for the Federal Reserve, as it can lead to a sustained increase in the national unemployment rate.

The third element of the weak labour data was found in the private sector employment reports, such as those provided by the ADP National Employment Report or similar mid-week updates. These figures indicated that private-sector hiring had slowed significantly compared to previous months. The combination of rising layoffs, stagnant re-employment, and a slowdown in new job creation created a narrative of a labour market that was no longer as robust as previously believed. As reported by TipRanks, these data points were the primary drivers behind the 1% drop in both the SPY and QQQ ETFs (TipRanks, 2026).

## Market Impacts and Sector Performance

The impact of the weak labour data was felt across the breadth of the US stock market, though the QQQ ETF experienced slightly more pronounced volatility due to its concentration in the technology sector. Technology and growth stocks are traditionally more sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations and economic growth forecasts. When labour data suggests a potential recession or a significant slowdown, investors often rotate out of high-growth assets and into more defensive positions.

The SPY ETF, which represents a more diversified cross-section of the US economy, also saw a decline of over 1%. This indicates that the selling pressure was not confined to a single sector but was a broad-based reaction to the perceived economic risks. Financial institutions, industrial companies, and consumer discretionary firms within the S&P 500 index all faced downward pressure as the implications of a weakening labour market were factored into corporate earnings expectations.

Simultaneously, the bond market reacted to the news with a decline in Treasury yields. As the odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut increased, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell, reflecting a "flight to safety" among investors. In the context of the stock market, lower yields can sometimes support equity valuations, but on this occasion, the concerns regarding the underlying health of the economy outweighed the potential benefits of lower borrowing costs. The surge in rate cut odds, as noted by market analysts, suggests that the market is now pricing in a more aggressive timeline for the Federal Reserve to lower the federal funds rate in an effort to prevent a deeper economic contraction (TipRanks, 2026).

## Reactions from Analysts and Investors

The reaction from the investment community was swift, with many analysts adjusting their short-term outlooks for the US economy. The consensus among market participants shifted from a "higher for longer" interest rate environment to one where the Federal Reserve might be forced to intervene sooner than expected. The surge in rate cut odds was a direct reflection of this shift in sentiment.

Financial commentators noted that the "bad news is good news" mantra, which sometimes applies when weak economic data leads to lower interest rates, did not fully take hold on 5 February. Instead, the severity of the labour data sparked fears that the Federal Reserve might have waited too long to pivot its policy, potentially putting the economy at risk of a "hard landing". This term refers to a situation where the central bank's efforts to control inflation result in a significant economic recession.

According to TipRanks, the investor digestion of these data points was characterized by a move away from risk-on assets. The fact that both the SPY and QQQ closed down by over 1% suggests a high level of conviction among sellers. Institutional investors, including hedge funds and pension funds, likely rebalanced their portfolios in response to the increased probability of a shift in the interest rate cycle. The surge in rate cut odds was particularly notable in the futures market, where traders increased their bets on a 25 or 50 basis point reduction at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

## Next Steps and Future Economic Outlook

Following the market movements of 5 February 2026, the focus of investors has shifted toward upcoming economic releases that could either confirm or contradict the trends seen in the trio of weak jobs data. The most significant of these is the monthly Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, which provides the most comprehensive view of the US employment situation, including the official unemployment rate and average hourly earnings.

If the NFP report aligns with the weak data seen on Thursday, it is likely that the pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement a rate cut will intensify. Market participants will be closely monitoring the statements of Federal Reserve officials for any signs of a change in rhetoric. Any indication that the central bank is becoming more concerned about the employment side of its mandate could lead to further volatility in the SPY and QQQ ETFs as the market adjusts to a new policy reality.

Furthermore, the corporate earnings season will continue to play a role in market performance. Investors will be looking for guidance from major corporations regarding their hiring plans and capital expenditure in light of the softening labour market. If companies begin to announce significant layoffs or reduced growth targets, the downward pressure on equity indices could persist. For the time being, the events of 5 February 2026 stand as a significant turning point in the market's assessment of the US economic trajectory and the anticipated response from monetary authorities (TipRanks, 2026).
