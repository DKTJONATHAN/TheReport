# EXPOSED: How Gava is Using Your Taxes to Pay ‘Keyboard Warriors’ to Silence You (While the Cybercrime Bill Waits to Finish the Job)

Wacha tuambiane ukweli.

If you thought the high cost of living was the only way this government was choking you, think again. While you are busy stressing about the price of unga and fuel, the machinery at State House has been busy cooking up something darker.

Today, we are peeling back the mask.

Reports hitting my desk—and confirmed by the latest shout-outs from human rights watchdogs—reveal a dirty game being played on the digital streets of X and TikTok. There is a battalion of paid bloggers, the so-called "State Trolls," whose only job description is to harass, intimidate, and gaslight any Kenyan who dares to ask, *"Pesa ilienda wapi?"*

## Your Taxes at Work: Funding Your Own Harassment

It is the irony of the century. You pay tax on bread, they take that money. You pay housing levy (for houses you will never see), they take that money. And what do they use it for? To pay a jobless graduate Ksh 527 to go online and insult you for demanding accountability.

These aren't just random haters. This is systematic harassment. If you are a vocal woman, a Gen Z activist, or just a concerned mwananchi, you have seen them. They swarm your notifications like bees immediately after you post something critical about the regime. They body-shame, they doxx, and they spread fake news.

Why? To tire you out. To make you say, *"Ah, wacha ikae"* and deactivate your account.

## The Double-Tap: Trolls First, Jail Second

But here is where it gets dangerous. These trolls are just the soft power. The hard power is the legislation they are trying to force down our throats.

The state knows that paying bloggers isn’t enough because Kenyans are stubborn. We don’t fear noise. So, they need a legal weapon to lock you up when the insults don't work.

That is exactly why they are rushing the **Cybercrime Bill 2025**.

As I exposed in my earlier investigative piece—**[Why Kenya's New Cybercrime Bill Must Be Rejected: A Threat to Your Freedom](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.jonathanmwaniki.co.ke/cybercrime-bill-exposed)**—this bill is not about catching fraudsters or hackers. It is about legalizing the kidnapping of opinion shapers.

The trolls are the bait; the Bill is the trap.

If you fight back against the state-sponsored bully online, the new Bill gives the authorities the power to arrest *you* for "incitement" or "misusing a computer system." They want to create a scenario where:

1. You get bullied into silence by bots.
2. You refuse to be silent, so they use the Cybercrime Bill to arrest you without a warrant.

## Vitu Kwa Ground

Look at the timing. The economy is struggling, the shilling is dancing, and the hospitals are empty. Instead of fixing these issues, the priority is policing your WhatsApp status and Tweets.

They want you to believe that the enemy is the activist asking for medicine in hospitals. They want you to believe the enemy is the Gen Z asking why roads are incomplete.

## The Verdict

We cannot allow this digital dictatorship to take root. We know their playbook now. When you see those coordinated attacks online, know that it is a desperate regime trying to control the narrative.

Do not let them intimidate you. And more importantly, do not let them pass that Cybercrime Bill quietly.

Kama mbaya, mbaya. We will not shut up.
