# 10 Mind-Blowing Facts About Safaricom That You Didn’t Know

Safaricom is more than a phone company—it's a force that moves Kenyan life, cash, and culture. CEO Peter Ndegwa recently dropped staggering numbers in an interview, but the impact runs deeper than you think. Here are ten jaw-dropping facts and some wild “what ifs” that will change how you see your mobile phone.

***

## 1. Safaricom Moves Trillions (Yes, Trillions)

Every single day, Safaricom’s M-Pesa system processes over **KSh 80 billion**—much of it just from the 150 million transactions made daily. That means, every hour, Safaricom moves enough money to run a small country.

***

## 2. 7% of Kenya’s Entire GDP Runs Through Safaricom

About **7% to 8% of Kenya’s total economy** flows through Safaricom platforms. If you add up every business, every salary, and every shop, odds are, the money touched Safaricom.

***

## 3. Every Kenyan Is a Customer—Twice

There are **50 million unique customers** in Kenya alone. With a national population of just over 50 million, that means almost every man, woman, and child has an account—and many have more than one.

***

## 4. M-Pesa Outnumbers Citizens

Safaricom’s M-Pesa logs **150 million transactions every day**—that’s nearly three times the total population, transacting cash, airtime, and payments.

***

## 5. Safaricom Earns Billions From Just Cents

If Safaricom ever added just **KSh 0.05 (5 cents)** secretly to each transaction, it would pocket **KSh 7.5 million per day**—over **KSh 2.7 billion every year**. That tiny fee could build a major hospital every 6 weeks.

***

## 6. Merchants and Agents Outnumber Police

With **2 million merchants** and over **300,000 agents**, the Safaricom network is bigger than security forces and political parties—combined.

***

## 7. Nearly Every Retail Shop Runs on Safaricom

Walk into any retail shop, duka, or petrol station. Odds are, it relies on **Lipa Na M-Pesa**. From mama mbogas in Gikomba to mega supermarkets, Safaricom is the real cashier behind the counter.

***

## 8. M-Pesa Handles More Than the Nairobi Stock Exchange

Daily value exchanged via M-Pesa dwarfs all trading volume at the NSE. On average, **Safaricom’s digital platform moves more money than all Kenyan stocks combined**—by lunchtime.

***

## 9. A Coin for Every Kenyan Is Billions

If Safaricom “misplaced” just one shilling per user, that’s **KSh 50 million gone instantly**—enough for free secondary school for thousands of students every year.

***

## 10. Kenya’s Power Broker

When Safaricom participates in charity, it’s never pennies. Last year alone, it invested **KSh 8 billion** in health and education. That’s more than several government ministries spend on entire programs.

***

## Bottom Line: Your Phone Number Is the Key to Kenya

Think a few coins don’t matter? With Safaricom’s scale—every microfee, bonus, or blunder is multiplied by millions. Next time you pay, call, save, or send money, remember just how deep the green runs in your everyday life.
