# Former French Minister Jack Lang Denies Epstein-Linked Allegations Amid New Financial Probe

The French political landscape has been jolted by the announcement of a preliminary investigation into one of its most enduring figures, Jack Lang. The former minister, who served in various high-profile capacities under the presidency of François Mitterrand, has found himself and his daughter, Caroline Lang, at the center of a probe initiated by France’s financial crimes prosecutors. The investigation stems from revelations contained within the documents associated with the late American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a firm response to the unfolding legal situation, Lang has characterized the allegations as entirely baseless, asserting his confidence in the eventual vindication of his reputation.

At 86 years of age, Jack Lang remains a formidable presence in French cultural and political life. His tenure as the Minister of Culture and later as the Minister of Education left an indelible mark on the nation, making the current legal scrutiny particularly significant. The National Financial Prosecutor’s Office, known in France as the Parquet National Financier or PNF, confirmed on Friday that it had opened a case to examine the nature of the mentions of Lang and his daughter within the Epstein files. These files, which have been subject to intense international scrutiny since their release, contain a vast array of names, flight logs, and testimonies related to Epstein’s global network.

## The Nature of the Preliminary Investigation

The opening of a preliminary investigation by the PNF does not equate to a formal charge or an admission of guilt. In the French legal system, such a step is taken to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a full-scale judicial inquiry. The PNF specifically focuses on complex financial crimes, including money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption. The inclusion of Lang’s name in this context suggests that the prosecutors are looking into potential financial irregularities or transactions that may have intersected with Epstein’s operations.

Lang’s reaction to the news has been one of defiance mixed with a stated sense of calm. Speaking through a formal statement, he emphasized that he welcomes the opportunity to address the claims directly. He noted that the investigation would bring much-needed light to the accusations that he believes are intended to question his probity and honor. By using terms such as serenity and relief, Lang is positioning himself as a man with nothing to hide, suggesting that the legal process will ultimately serve to clear his name rather than tarnish it.

## The Shadow of the Epstein Files

The documents often referred to as the Epstein files consist of thousands of pages of depositions, emails, and administrative records from various lawsuits involving Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. Since Epstein’s death in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019, these documents have been a
