## The Bamboo Lie

If you have been paying 2,500 shillings for a "Bamboo Shoot Salad" in some over-priced Westlands bistro, you have been played like a cheap guitar. The latest "superfood" craze is actually a toxic trap that could leave you with goitre and a body full of lead. While the influencers are busy posting photos of their "healthy" greens, the actual science reveals that this stuff is packed with cyanogenic glycosides. If your chef is more interested in TikTok than boiling your food properly, those chemicals turn into thiocyanate, which blocks your thyroid and gives you a neck swelling larger than a Kilimani ego. 

## Science or Just Vibes?

Let us look at the facts before the "health gurus" come for my neck. This supposed breakthrough from Anglia Ruskin University is based on a research pile thinner than a socialite’s waistline. They only found 16 studies worth reading. That is it. They are claiming it helps with blood sugar and "faecal volume" (yes, they actually studied your toilet habits, darling), but at what cost? Some of these bamboo samples had lead levels 4.6 times higher than what is safe. Wueh, Kanairo people are really out here eating heavy metals for the aesthetic. Tea has been spilt, and it tastes like battery acid.

## The Real Agenda

It is funny how we are being told to eat literal grass just as the cost of living hits the ceiling. While our "leaders" are busy ignoring the scandals in /posts/nairobi-s-rising-towers, human-stories, they want the rest of us to be satisfied with bamboo cookies. It is the ultimate distraction. They build luxury skyscrapers on every inch of soil and then tell the common man to protect his cells with "antioxidants" found in garden weeds. The irony is thicker than the smog on Mombasa Road.

## Boiling for Your Life

The experts say you have to boil the life out of these shoots to make them safe. But let us be real, half of these "healthy" cafes in Kanairo can barely get an order of fries right. Are you really going to trust them to neutralise the cyanide in your lunch? Between the arsenic, the lead, and the risk of your thyroid giving up on you, bamboo is not a superfood. It is a scam dressed in green. Stick to your sukuma wiki and leave the grass to the pandas, honey. Your "faecal volume" can find another way to improve without you turning into a chemistry set.
