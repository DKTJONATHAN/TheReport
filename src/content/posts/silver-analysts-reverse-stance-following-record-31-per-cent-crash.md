# Silver Analysts Reverse Stance Following Record 31 Per Cent Crash

## Timeline of Market Events and Key Facts

On 1 February 2026, financial news outlet TheStreet reported a significant shift in the outlook for the silver market following a period of extreme volatility. The report, titled "Silver Bears Drop Bombshell Reversal After Record 31% Crash," detailed a sudden change in sentiment from market strategists who had previously predicted a sustained downturn for the precious metal. 

The sequence of events began earlier in the final week of January 2026, when two specific analysts issued formal warnings that silver prices were positioned to tumble. According to the report by TheStreet, these warnings were followed by a rapid and historic market correction, resulting in a 31 per cent decline in silver’s valuation. This figure represents a record crash for the commodity within the specified timeframe. Immediately following this 31 per cent liquidation, the same analysts who had forecasted the drop transitioned from a bearish to a neutral or bullish stance, marking what has been described as a "bombshell reversal" in the commodities sector.

The primary facts established by the report include the magnitude of the price drop, the timing of the analyst warnings, and the subsequent retraction of their bearish theses. The data indicates that the 31 per cent crash served as a catalyst for the reassessment of silver’s near-term price trajectory.

## Background: The Initial Bearish Outlook

Prior to the record crash, the silver market had been under intense scrutiny from institutional researchers. In the days leading up to 1 February 2026, market sentiment was predominantly negative. The two analysts cited by TheStreet had warned investors that silver would experience a significant decline, citing various technical and fundamental factors that suggested the metal was overvalued or facing decreased industrial demand.

Silver, which functions both as a precious metal for investment and an industrial metal for electronics and solar energy, often experiences volatility based on macroeconomic shifts. The warnings issued earlier in the week were part of a broader trend of caution regarding commodities. These analysts had suggested that the "tumble" would be a necessary correction to align the price with current market realities. However, the speed and depth of the 31 per cent crash exceeded the initial parameters of many bearish forecasts, leading to the eventual reversal of these positions.

The initial bearish stance was predicated on the assumption that silver would lose value gradually. The suddenness of the 31 per cent drop created a new market environment where the previous arguments for a "tumble" were effectively realised in a single, compressed event.

## Key Developments: The 31 Per Cent Crash and Analyst Reversal

The defining development of this story is the 31 per cent crash, which TheStreet identifies as a record-breaking event for the silver market. In the context of commodity trading, a 31 per cent decline in such a short period is considered a "flash crash" or a major liquidity event. Such movements are often triggered by a combination of high-frequency trading algorithms, margin calls, and a lack of immediate buyers at lower price levels.

Following the achievement of this 31 per cent low, the two analysts involved in the initial warnings changed their tune. A reversal of this nature in the financial industry typically occurs when analysts believe that an asset has become "oversold." When a commodity drops by nearly a third of its value in a matter of days, the fundamental value proposition changes. TheStreet reports that these analysts are no longer warning of further tumbles but are instead adjusting their models to account for the new, lower price floor.

The term "bombshell reversal" used in the report highlights the rarity of analysts changing their public stance so quickly after a major market event. Usually, analysts may wait for a period of consolidation before revising their outlooks. In this instance, the magnitude of the crash was sufficient to prompt an immediate reassessment of the silver market's potential for recovery or stabilisation.

## Impacts on the Commodities Market

The impact of a 31 per cent crash in silver is felt across multiple sectors of the economy. For investors in silver-backed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), the record drop resulted in significant portfolio devaluations. TheStreet’s reporting suggests that the volatility has created a high-stakes environment for both retail and institutional traders.

In the physical silver market, such a crash often leads to a disconnect between the "paper" price (the spot price traded on exchanges) and the "physical" price (the cost to purchase actual silver bars or coins). When the spot price crashes by 31 per cent, physical demand often spikes as buyers attempt to acquire the metal at a perceived discount, which can lead to high premiums and supply shortages at bullion dealers.

Furthermore, the reversal by the two analysts has introduced a layer of uncertainty into the market. When prominent voices change their tune so rapidly, it can lead to increased volatility as traders attempt to decipher whether the 31 per cent crash represents a bottom or merely a pause in a longer-term decline. The impact on market liquidity is also a factor, as the rapid price movement may have cleared out "stop-loss" orders, leaving the market with fewer active participants in the immediate aftermath.

## Reactions from the Financial Community

The reaction to the 31 per cent crash and the subsequent analyst reversal has been one of caution and intense observation. According to the report from TheStreet, the fact that analysts are "changing their tune" is a significant indicator of the current market psychology. In the broader financial community, such reversals are often viewed as a sign that the "bears", those who bet on falling prices, have reached their target or have been surprised by the velocity of the move.

Market participants often look to these analysts for guidance on trend duration. The initial warnings of a tumble were validated by the crash, but the "bombshell" nature of the reversal suggests that the analysts now see more risk in staying bearish than in turning neutral or bullish. This shift in sentiment can influence the actions of hedge funds and commodity trading advisors (CTAs) who rely on analyst reports to calibrate their algorithmic strategies.

While the specific names of the analysts were not the primary focus of the snippet provided by TheStreet, their influence is noted through the market's reaction to their changing forecasts. The reversal serves as a public acknowledgement that the 31 per cent crash has fundamentally altered the risk-reward profile of silver as an investment.

## Next Steps for Silver Investors

Following the report on 1 February 2026, the next steps for the silver market involve a period of price discovery. Investors and analysts will be watching to see if the 31 per cent crash holds as a long-term floor or if the market will experience further "aftershocks."

TheStreet indicates that the analysts' change in tune is the primary development to watch. The next steps for these analysts will likely involve publishing updated price targets and revised supply-demand forecasts for the remainder of 2026. Market observers will also be looking for data on industrial silver consumption to see if the lower price points stimulate increased buying from the solar and electronics industries.

Additionally, the silver market will be sensitive to any further reports from TheStreet or other financial news outlets regarding the stability of the precious metals sector. The record nature of the 31 per cent crash ensures that silver will remain a focal point of commodity news in the coming weeks. Whether the "bombshell reversal" by the analysts precedes a period of recovery or a period of stagnant consolidation remains to be seen, as the market processes the rapid loss of value and the subsequent shift in professional sentiment.
