The first week of February 2026 has proven to be a pivotal moment for Kenya, as the nation grapples with a complex web of domestic economic pressures, shifting political alliances, and a rapidly evolving role in international security. From the lecture halls of technical colleges to the high-stakes corridors of diplomatic power, the country is navigating a period of significant transformation. As the government attempts to balance fiscal discipline with public service delivery, the resulting friction has sparked protests, legal battles, and a re-evaluation of Kenya’s standing on the global stage.

## The Rising Cost of Education and Public Services

One of the most pressing issues facing the Kenyan public is the sharp increase in the cost of education and essential government services. Students and tutors across the country have expressed deep dissatisfaction following the government’s decision to nearly double tuition fees for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions. Under the modular curriculum, which was initially rolled out in May 2025, annual fees have surged from approximately KSh 56,000 to KSh 105,000. This move has been met with fierce backlash, as many families argue that the hike undermines the government’s promise to make technical education accessible to the youth.

The tension reached a breaking point at the Olessos National Polytechnic, where students staged night protests that were met with a heavy-handed response from the police. Reports and footage from the scene showed armed officers deploying tear gas to disperse the learners, with smoke billowing from campus facilities. These protests highlight a growing sense of frustration among the youth, who feel increasingly squeezed by the rising cost of living and the perceived commercialisation of public education.

Simultaneously, the Department of Immigration Services has come under fire for the unavailability of cheaper passport options. Kenyans seeking to travel abroad for work or study have raised concerns over a price hike on applications, coupled with a persistent shortage of passport booklets. While the government has assured the public of swift action to resolve these shortages, the delay has caused significant disruption for many citizens. These economic pressures are not limited to education and travel, as the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) also announced a 36-hour service disruption for system maintenance, further complicating the ease of doing business and tax compliance for both locals and foreigners.

## Political Realignment and the Azimio Fracture

The political landscape in Kenya remains as volatile as ever, with the opposition Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition facing internal turmoil. A significant rift has emerged within the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), the coalition’s largest party, following a controversial interview by Edwin Sifuna on Citizen TV. Oburu Odinga, a senior figure within the party, publicly slammed Sifuna, asserting that no individual is bigger than the party. This public spat is a clear indication of the deepening fractures within ODM, as different factions vie for influence in a post-election environment.

The situation was further complicated by leadership changes within the broader Azimio coalition. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta recently presided over a meeting that saw the appointment of Kalonzo Musyoka as the coalition leader and Caroli Omondi as the Secretary General. However, these changes have been rejected by sections of the ODM leadership, leading to a public standoff between the former president’s allies and those loyal to the traditional ODM hierarchy. This internal power struggle threatens to weaken the opposition’s ability to provide a unified front against the current administration.

President William Ruto has been quick to capitalise on these divisions, while also warning against calls for nationwide protests. In a recent address, the President hit back at opposition politicians, claiming that such demonstrations would have an immense negative impact on the country’s economy. He urged the youth not to be used as pawns in political games, emphasizing that his administration is focused on reshaping the government through fresh appointments and policy reforms. Among his latest moves, the President appointed Frank Ole Denmark as an ambassador and named new deputies for missions in Somalia, Russia, and Tanzania, signaling a continued effort to consolidate his diplomatic team.

## International Security and the Shadow of Foreign Wars

Kenya’s involvement in international affairs has taken a somber turn with the discovery of more bodies of Kenyan nationals fighting for Russia in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Reports indicate that these individuals were often lured to Qatar with the promise of well-paying jobs in Europe, only to find themselves recruited into military service on the front lines. The tragedy was highlighted by the heart-wrenching story of a family in Kenya who recently buried an empty coffin for a relative killed in the war, as the body could not be recovered. The government is facing increasing pressure to investigate these recruitment networks and protect vulnerable citizens from being exploited by foreign military interests.

On a more strategic level, the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) have joined the United States, the United Kingdom, and 17 other nations in a major maritime security exercise known as Cutlass Express 2026. This training, conducted in the Indian Ocean, is aimed at enhancing domain awareness and strengthening the fight against regional insurgents. The partnership with the U.S. was further solidified by a recent KSh 8.9 billion runway expansion at Manda Bay, a project designed to boost Kenya’s security capabilities.

In a significant diplomatic development, the Ministry of Interior announced the reopening of the Kenya-Somalia border. This move is expected to provide a major boost for miraa traders and regional stability, marking the end of a decade-long closure that strained ties between the two neighbours. The reopening is seen as a vital step toward strengthening economic cooperation and addressing security challenges along the shared border.

## Legal Battles and Governance Challenges

The Kenyan judiciary remains a critical battleground for issues of governance and accountability. In a major win for Members of Parliament, the Court of Appeal recently overturned a High Court ruling that had struck down the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). This decision follows a long-standing legal battle between Chief Justice Martha Koome and Speaker Moses Wetang'ula over the legality of the funds. The reinstatement of the NG-CDF is seen as a victory for local development projects, though critics continue to raise concerns about the potential for misuse of these funds.

In another high-profile case, the High Court cleared the way for the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to arrest a senior government official over multibillion-shilling graft allegations. The official, the CEO of the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF), had sought to block his arrest, claiming that the criminal justice system was being used to intimidate him. However, the court’s decision underscores the ongoing efforts to hold public officials accountable for the management of public resources.

The issue of enforced disappearances also continues to haunt the security sector. The High Court recently ordered the Inspector General of Police and the Director of Criminal Investigations to produce an abducted trader from Busia, dead or alive. This case adds to a growing list of incidents where state operators are accused of involvement in abductions, a charge that the government consistently denies. These legal challenges highlight the ongoing struggle to balance national security with the protection of fundamental human rights.

## Economic Investments and Technological Shifts

Despite the domestic challenges, Kenya continues to attract significant foreign investment. A Dubai-based firm, the Maser Group, has announced a KSh 206 billion Public-Private Partnership (PPP) investment targeting Kenya’s farmland and data centres. The government is currently weighing plans to lease sections of key food-producing regions, such as the Galana Kulalu irrigation scheme, to boost food security. This investment is part of a broader push to modernise Kenya’s agricultural sector and position the country as a regional hub for digital infrastructure.

In the realm of technology, WhatsApp has rolled out new group chat and privacy features that are expected to transform how Kenyans communicate. These updates include member tags and stricter account settings, providing users with more control over their digital interactions. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has issued a warning against the practice of creating "money bouquets," noting that disfiguring currency is a violation of the law. In response, creative florists have already begun inventing new ways to incorporate financial gifts into floral arrangements without damaging the notes.

## Environmental Innovation and Public Safety

As the climate continues to change, Kenyan architecture is adapting with innovative solutions for cooling buildings without the need for air conditioning. Modern designs are increasingly focusing on passive cooling techniques, such as stopping heat before it enters a structure. This approach not only reduces energy consumption but also aligns with global efforts to promote sustainable urban development.

Public safety remains a top priority, especially in the wake of a gas depot explosion in Nairobi’s Donholm estate. The incident caused widespread panic, with residents fleeing for safety as emergency teams responded to the blast. In response to such disasters, the Nairobi County government is set to launch a 24-hour Emergency Command Centre. This facility will oversee a major overhaul of disaster response, including a detailed plan that features an inventory of fire engines, ambulances, and rescue boats.

## Conclusion

The events of early February 2026 paint a picture of a nation at a crossroads. While Kenya faces significant hurdles in the form of rising costs, political instability, and security threats, there are also signs of resilience and progress. The judiciary’s role in upholding the rule of law, the continued influx of foreign investment, and the adoption of new technologies all point toward a country that is actively shaping its future. As the government navigates these turbulent waters, the focus must remain on addressing the needs of the citizens and ensuring that the path to development is both inclusive and sustainable. The coming months will undoubtedly bring further challenges, but the foundations being laid today will determine Kenya’s trajectory for years to come.
