# Minute Maid to Discontinue Frozen Juice Cans After 80 Years

## Historical Background of Minute Maid Frozen Concentrate

The history of Minute Maid is inextricably linked to the post-war industrial boom of the United States. In 1945, the National Research Corporation (NRC) of Boston developed a method for evaporating water from orange juice using a high-vacuum process originally designed for dehydrating medical supplies, such as penicillin and blood plasma, for the United States Army. According to historical records from the Florida Department of Citrus, the goal was to provide nutritious, palatable orange juice to soldiers overseas. Although the war ended before the product could be shipped to the front lines, the technology laid the foundation for the commercial frozen juice industry.

In 1946, the NRC formed the Florida Foods Corporation, which was later renamed Vacuum Foods Corporation. The company launched its first commercial product, a frozen orange juice concentrate that required the consumer to add three cans of water to one can of concentrate. This product was marketed under the name Minute Maid, a brand name chosen to highlight the speed and convenience of preparation compared to hand-squeezing fresh oranges. By 1948, the brand had gained significant national attention, aided by a marketing partnership with singer Bing Crosby, who became a spokesperson and a shareholder in the company.

For eight decades, the 12-ounce (355ml) frozen can remained a staple of the American breakfast table. It revolutionised the citrus industry by allowing orange juice to be transported across long distances without the weight of water, significantly reducing shipping costs and making orange juice a year-round commodity rather than a seasonal luxury. However, as reported by The Seattle Times on 4 February 2026, the parent company, Coca-Cola, has officially moved to halt the production and sale of these frozen juice concentrates, citing a permanent shift in consumer purchasing habits.

## Key Developments and the Decision to Discontinue

The decision to "put on ice" the frozen canned juice line follows years of declining sales in the frozen food aisle. Industry data from the last two decades indicates a steady migration of consumers away from frozen concentrates towards ready-to-drink (RTD) refrigerated juices. According to market analysis, the frozen juice category has seen a consistent double-digit decline in volume as modern consumers prioritise convenience and perceived freshness over the cost savings associated with concentrate.

Coca-Cola, which acquired Minute Maid in 1960, has been restructuring its beverage portfolio to focus on high-growth segments. The company has noted that the infrastructure required to maintain the "cold chain" for frozen products is increasingly expensive relative to the shrinking market share of the format. The Seattle Times reports that the phase-out is part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and focus on the Minute Maid Zero Sugar line and the Simply brand, which has overtaken frozen concentrate in total revenue.

The timeline for the discontinuation indicates that retailers will see a gradual reduction in stock throughout the first half of 2026. While some niche or private-label frozen concentrates may remain on the market, the exit of Minute Maid, the brand that pioneered the category, marks the functional end of the frozen juice era for major national retailers. Logistics experts suggest that the shelf space previously occupied by frozen juice will likely be repurposed for high-growth frozen categories, such as plant-based frozen meals or premium frozen desserts.

## Impacts on the Beverage Industry and Supply Chain

The discontinuation of Minute Maid frozen concentrate has immediate implications for the citrus supply chain, particularly in Florida and Brazil. Frozen concentrate was traditionally a primary outlet for "processing grade" oranges, which may have cosmetic defects but are suitable for juicing. The manufacturing process for concentrate involves heating the juice to remove water, which also pasteurises the product, allowing for long-term storage in industrial freezers. This served as a vital buffer for the industry, allowing processors to store excess inventory during bumper crop years to offset shortages during years of frost or disease, such as citrus greening.

With the removal of this large-scale frozen outlet, citrus growers must pivot further towards the "Not-From-Concentrate" (NFC) market. NFC juice requires more sophisticated logistics, as the juice must be kept chilled but not frozen, and it has a shorter shelf life. According to reports from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the shift to NFC has already transformed the landscape of Florida’s citrus processing, with many older concentrate plants having closed or consolidated over the last decade.

Retailers are also expected to feel the impact of this change. The frozen juice door in the supermarket has been a consistent, if declining, fixture for 80 years. The removal of the Minute Maid line represents a loss of a legacy product that often served as a "loss leader" to draw budget-conscious shoppers into the frozen food section. Analysts suggest that the transition will require retailers to re-evaluate their frozen beverage strategy, potentially shifting towards frozen smoothie blends or concentrated liquid enhancers that do not require freezing.

## Consumer Reactions and Market Trends

Consumer behaviour has been the primary driver behind the decline of frozen concentrate. In the mid-20th century, the act of mixing concentrate with water was viewed as a modern convenience. However, by the early 21st century, the three-minute preparation time became a barrier for consumers accustomed to immediate consumption. The rise of "premiumisation" in the juice category also played a role, as consumers began to associate the "fresh-pressed" taste of refrigerated NFC juices with higher quality and better health outcomes, despite the nutritional profiles often being similar.

Market research indicates that the demographic for frozen concentrate has skewed older in recent years. Younger generations, including Millennials and Generation Z, have shown a marked preference for refrigerated carafes and single-serve bottles. The Seattle Times notes that the nostalgia associated with the frozen cans has not been enough to sustain the volume required for large-scale production. In social media discussions following the announcement, some consumers expressed regret over the loss of a childhood staple, while others admitted they had not purchased the product in years.

Furthermore, the environmental impact of packaging has influenced market trends. While the traditional cardboard and metal cans were relatively efficient to transport, the energy required to keep the product at sub-zero temperatures throughout the entire supply chain is significant. As corporate sustainability goals become more prominent, the move away from energy-intensive frozen distribution aligns with broader industry efforts to reduce carbon footprints.

## Next Steps for the Minute Maid Brand

Following the discontinuation of the frozen line, the Minute Maid brand will continue to exist through its extensive range of refrigerated and shelf-stable products. Coca-Cola has indicated that the brand will focus on innovation within the "functional beverage" space, including juices fortified with vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. The Minute Maid Pulpy and Minute Maid Zero Sugar lines have shown resilience in global markets, and the company intends to redirect the resources previously used for frozen concentrate into these growing segments.

For consumers who still prefer the taste or cost-effectiveness of concentrate, the transition will involve moving to refrigerated concentrates or liquid drops, though these do not offer the same long-term storage capabilities as the frozen cans. The Seattle Times reports that Coca-Cola will work closely with its bottling partners and retail distributors to ensure a smooth transition and to fill the gap in the breakfast category with alternative Minute Maid offerings.

The final shipments of Minute Maid frozen concentrate are expected to reach warehouses by the end of the current fiscal quarter. Once existing stocks are depleted, the 80-year run of the product will officially conclude. This move reflects a broader trend in the food and beverage industry where legacy formats are being retired in favour of products that align with the speed, health perceptions, and convenience demands of the modern consumer. Details regarding the exact date of the final production run remain unclear, but the company has confirmed that the decision is final and covers all varieties of the frozen canned line, including orange, lemonade, and limeade.
