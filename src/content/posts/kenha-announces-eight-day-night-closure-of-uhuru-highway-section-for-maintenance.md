# KeNHA Announces Eight Day Night Closure of Uhuru Highway Section for Maintenance

The Kenya National Highways Authority, commonly referred to as KeNHA, has officially announced a temporary night-time closure of a significant section of Uhuru Highway in Nairobi. This decision was communicated through a public notice and reported by Citizen Digital on February 7, 2026. The closure is intended to facilitate essential highway maintenance works along one of the most critical transport corridors in the capital city of Kenya. According to the authority, the maintenance schedule is designed to minimise disruption to the daily flow of traffic while ensuring that the structural integrity and safety of the road surface are maintained to required standards.

The affected stretch of the highway is located between two major landmarks in the city, specifically the University of Nairobi Roundabout and the Westlands Roundabout. This section serves as a primary artery for vehicles moving between the central business district and the northern and western suburbs of Nairobi. The closure is set to take place over a period of eight days, beginning on the night of Friday, February 6, 2026, and concluding on the morning of Friday, February 13, 2026. To reduce the impact on commuters and commercial transport, the works will be restricted to the late-night and early-morning hours, specifically between 10 pm and 5 am each night.

## Purpose of the Maintenance Works

The Kenya National Highways Authority stated that the planned activities are part of a routine maintenance programme. The primary objectives of these works are to improve road safety and to ensure a smoother flow of traffic along the busy corridor. Uhuru Highway is a vital link that connects the city centre to Westlands and serves as a gateway to major outbound routes leading to the western parts of the country. Over time, high volumes of traffic, including heavy commercial vehicles, contribute to the wear and tear of the road surface. By conducting these repairs, the authority aims to address any existing defects and prevent further deterioration of the infrastructure.

Routine maintenance typically involves tasks such as pothole patching, resurfacing of worn-out sections, clearing of drainage systems, and the repainting of road markings. These interventions are necessary to maintain the serviceability of the road and to extend its lifespan. The choice of night-time hours for these activities is a standard practice in urban infrastructure management, as it allows engineers and contractors to work with fewer obstructions while avoiding the peak traffic hours that characterise Nairobi's daytime environment.

## Alternative Routes for Motorists

In light of the scheduled closures, KeNHA has provided a comprehensive traffic management plan to guide motorists. The authority has identified several alternative routes that drivers can use to reach their destinations during the hours when the section of Uhuru Highway is inaccessible. These diversions are intended to distribute the traffic load across the existing road network and to prevent congestion at the points of closure.

For motorists who are accessing Uhuru Highway and Chiromo Road with the intention of travelling towards Nakuru, several options are available. These drivers have been advised to utilise Nyerere Road, which provides a connection through the city's administrative areas. Another option is Arboretum Drive, which offers a route through the Kileleshwa and Riverside areas. Additionally, the Westlands Ring Road can be used to bypass the closed section and rejoin the main highway further north. For those who prefer a more direct but potentially tolled route, the Nairobi Expressway remains an available alternative for traversing the city quickly.

Motorists heading in the opposite direction, towards Mombasa, also have several diversion options. The authority suggests that these drivers can divert via the Parklands Ring Road or Ojijo Road. Other viable routes include Kipande Road and Limuru Road, which lead back towards the city centre via University Way. Similar to the outbound traffic, those heading towards Mombasa can also opt to use the Nairobi Expressway to avoid the maintenance zone entirely. The availability of the Expressway provides a significant relief valve for the city's traffic during such periods of maintenance on the lower-level roads.

## Traffic Management and Safety Protocols

To ensure the safety of both road users and the construction crews, KeNHA has urged all motorists to adhere strictly to the proposed traffic management plan. The authority has indicated that police officers and traffic marshals will be deployed along the affected routes for the duration of the closure period. These personnel will be responsible for directing traffic, managing the diversions, and ensuring that motorists follow the temporary signs and instructions.

The cooperation of the public is considered essential for the successful execution of the maintenance works. Road users are encouraged to exercise patience and to plan their journeys in advance, particularly if they intend to travel during the late-night hours. The presence of heavy machinery and workers on the road necessitates a high level of alertness from drivers. Adhering to speed limits and following the guidance of the marshals will help to prevent accidents and ensure that the work proceeds without incident.

## The Role of KeNHA in National Infrastructure

The Kenya National Highways Authority is an autonomous statutory body established under the Kenya Roads Act of 2007. Its primary mandate is the management, development, rehabilitation, and maintenance of national trunk roads. These roads are classified as Class S, A, and B roads, which form the backbone of the country's transport network. The maintenance of Uhuru Highway falls directly under this mandate, as it is a key component of the international trunk road system that links Kenya to its neighbours.

The authority is responsible for ensuring that the national road network is in a condition that supports economic growth and social development. Well-maintained roads reduce vehicle operating costs, decrease travel times, and improve the overall efficiency of the transport sector. The current maintenance project on Uhuru Highway is a reflection of the authority's ongoing efforts to uphold these standards in a rapidly growing urban environment.

## Significance of the Uhuru Highway Corridor

Uhuru Highway is one of the most important roads in Nairobi, serving as a central spine for the city's transport system. It carries a diverse range of traffic, from private cars and public service vehicles to heavy trucks transporting goods across the East African region. The section between the University of Nairobi and Westlands is particularly busy, as it passes through major commercial, educational, and administrative hubs.

The highway also intersects with several other major roads, making it a critical junction for cross-city travel. The recent completion of the Nairobi Expressway, which runs above Uhuru Highway, has changed the dynamics of traffic in this area, but the lower-level road remains essential for local access and for vehicles that do not use the toll road. Maintaining the lower road is therefore just as important as managing the new elevated infrastructure to ensure a balanced and functional transport network.

## Impact on Local Logistics and Economy

Nairobi is a major regional hub for trade and logistics, and any disruption to its primary transport routes can have implications for the movement of goods. By scheduling the maintenance works at night, KeNHA is attempting to mitigate the impact on the economy. Most commercial deliveries and long-distance haulage occur during the day or in the early evening, and the 10 pm to 5 am window is generally the period of lowest demand for road space.

However, businesses that operate 24 hours a day, such as certain logistics companies, emergency services, and late-night retail outlets, will need to adjust their operations to account for the diversions. The clear communication of alternative routes is intended to help these stakeholders plan accordingly. The long-term benefits of a smoother and safer road surface are expected to outweigh the short-term inconvenience caused by the eight-day maintenance period.

## Future Outlook for Nairobi's Roads

The maintenance of Uhuru Highway is part of a broader strategy to modernise and sustain Nairobi's infrastructure. As the city continues to expand, the pressure on its road network increases, necessitating regular interventions and upgrades. The Kenya National Highways Authority has been involved in several large-scale projects aimed at de-congesting the city, including the construction of bypasses and the expansion of existing arterial roads.

Routine maintenance, such as the work currently being undertaken, is a cost-effective way to preserve these assets. It prevents the need for more expensive and disruptive full-scale reconstruction in the future. The authority's commitment to regular upkeep is a key factor in the sustainability of the country's infrastructure investments.

## Conclusion of Works and Resumption of Normal Traffic

KeNHA has confirmed that normal traffic operations on the affected section of Uhuru Highway will resume as soon as the maintenance works are completed. The target date for the full reopening of the road is the morning of Friday, February 13, 2026. Once the repairs are finished, motorists can expect an improved driving surface, which will contribute to a better overall experience on the road.

The authority has expressed its appreciation for the understanding and cooperation of the public during this period. By providing advance notice and clear alternatives, KeNHA aims to ensure that the necessary maintenance is carried out with the least possible impact on the residents and visitors of Nairobi. The successful completion of these works will mark another step in the ongoing effort to maintain and improve the quality of Kenya's national road network. According to the report by Citizen Digital, the authority remains focused on its goal of providing safe and reliable infrastructure for all road users.
