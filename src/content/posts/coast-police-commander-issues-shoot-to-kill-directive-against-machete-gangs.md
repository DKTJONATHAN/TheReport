# Coast Police Commander Issues Shoot-to-Kill Directive Against Machete Gangs

The security landscape of the Kenyan Coast has reached a critical turning point following a stern executive directive from the regional police leadership. Coast Regional Police Commander Ali Nuno has officially authorized law enforcement officers to utilize lethal force against machete-wielding criminals who have been terrorizing residents across the coastal counties. This directive comes as a response to a significant surge in violent robberies and organized gang activity that has left communities in Mombasa, Kilifi, and Kwale in a state of constant apprehension.

Commander Nuno issued the tough directive during a security briefing where he emphasized that the safety of law-abiding citizens and the protection of police officers remain the highest priorities. He stated that the police will no longer hesitate to use their firearms when the law permits, particularly when faced with suspects who carry pangas and other crude weapons with the intent to harm or rob. The commander noted that the era of soft policing against violent juvenile gangs has come to an end, signaling a shift toward a more aggressive tactical approach to restore order in the region.

## The Ultimatum: Reform or Leave

In a direct address to the individuals involved in these criminal networks, Commander Nuno offered a stark ultimatum. He categorized the future of these suspects into two distinct options: they must either desist from their criminal activities and undergo a process of reformation or they must vacate the Coast region entirely. The commander warned that those who choose to continue their path of violence will face the full force of the law, including the potential for fatal encounters with armed police units.

The commander’s rhetoric reflects the growing frustration within the security apparatus regarding the persistence of panga-wielding gangs. He noted that many of these individuals have been involved in crime for various reasons, but the justification for their actions no longer matters when the lives of innocent Kenyans are at stake. By providing a clear choice, the police leadership is attempting to dismantle the recruitment pipelines of these gangs while simultaneously warning active members that their days of operating with impunity are numbered.

## The Reign of Terror: Panga Gang Tactics

The coastal region has been plagued by a specific brand of violence characterized by the use of pangas, which are large, heavy knives or machetes. These weapons are easily accessible and have become the signature tool for gangs such as the notorious Panga Boys. Unlike traditional armed robbers who may use firearms, these gangs rely on the sheer intimidation and physical brutality of blade weapons to subdue their victims.

The tactics employed by these groups are often swift and violent. They typically target high-traffic areas, including markets, bus stops, and residential streets during the early morning or late evening hours. The psychological impact of panga attacks is profound, as the injuries inflicted by such weapons are often gruesome and life-altering. Residents have reported a sense of helplessness, as the gangs often move in large groups, making it difficult for individual citizens or unarmed security guards to intervene.

## CCTV Evidence and Public Outcry

The urgency of the new police directive has been fueled by the widespread circulation of CCTV footage on social media platforms. These videos have provided a chilling look into the operations of the panga gangs. In several clips, groups of young men are seen storming retail shops and open-air markets, brandishing machetes and forcing terrified patrons to surrender their valuables. The footage often shows the attackers fleeing the scene with mobile phones, cash, and other electronics within seconds of the initial assault.

This visual evidence has galvanized public opinion and put immense pressure on the National Police Service to take decisive action. The transparency provided by digital surveillance has stripped away any ambiguity regarding the nature of the threat. It has also highlighted the brazenness of the attackers, who often operate in broad daylight without masks, suggesting a lack of fear regarding legal consequences. Commander Nuno
