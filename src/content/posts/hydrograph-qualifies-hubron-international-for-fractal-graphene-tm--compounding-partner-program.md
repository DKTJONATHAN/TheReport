**MANCHESTER, United Kingdom** ,  HydroGraph Clean Power Inc. (CSE: HG) (OTCQB: HGRAF), a prominent developer of high-purity graphene, has announced a strategic expansion of its Compounding Partner Program by onboarding Hubron International. The move is designed to streamline the integration of HydroGraph’s proprietary Fractal Graphene™ into the global thermoplastics market, marking a significant step toward the industrial-scale adoption of nanomaterials.

Hubron International, headquartered in Manchester, brings over nine decades of materials science expertise to the partnership. As a global leader in black masterbatch and conductive polymer compounds, Hubron exports more than 85% of its production. The company’s technical infrastructure, which includes twin-screw extrusion and specialized processing lines, provides the necessary scale to transform raw graphene into functionalized industrial components.

The partnership addresses a critical bottleneck in the advanced materials sector: the transition from laboratory-grade nanomaterials to reliable, mass-produced industrial composites. By leveraging Hubron’s established distribution network, HydroGraph aims to penetrate high-growth markets including automotive manufacturing, aerospace, construction, and telecommunications.

“Our Compounding Partner Program supports the growing customer demand for graphene-enhanced materials that are both scalable and reliable,” stated Kjirstin Breure, President and Chief Executive Officer of HydroGraph. She noted that Hubron’s deep experience in maintaining conductive pathways while preserving nanoscale integrity is essential for expanding access to Fractal Graphene™ across international markets.

HydroGraph’s competitive advantage lies in its "explosion synthesis" production method. Unlike traditional chemical vapor deposition or exfoliation techniques, this process yields high-purity graphene with consistent batch quality and low energy consumption. The company remains one of the few producers globally to meet the rigorous Verified Graphene Producer® standards set by the Graphene Council.

For the broader business sector, this alliance signals a maturing of the graphene supply chain. By utilizing Hubron’s contract manufacturing and toll compounding capabilities, HydroGraph can offer flexible partnership models to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This allows for the "white-label" production of nanomaterial-enhanced solutions, enabling diverse industries to adopt graphene without the need for significant capital expenditure in specialized processing equipment.

As the demand for lighter, stronger, and more conductive materials intensifies, particularly within the electric vehicle (EV) and electronics sectors, the collaboration between HydroGraph and Hubron establishes a robust framework for the next generation of polymer science. The partnership is expected to expedite the delivery of graphene-enabled composites, providing a documented pathway for industrial clients to enhance product performance through nanotechnology.
