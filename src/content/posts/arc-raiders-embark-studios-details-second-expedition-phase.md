# ARC Raiders: Embark Studios Details Second Expedition Phase

## Introduction and Official Statements

Officials at Embark Studios, the Stockholm-based developer led by former Electronic Arts executive Patrick Söderlund, have released a comprehensive update regarding the development of ARC Raiders. According to the official communication published on 5 February 2026, the studio has initiated the "Second Expedition" phase, a critical milestone in the title's transition from its initial concept to a fully realised extraction adventure. The update, titled "Preparing for your second Expedition," provides specific details on the environmental hazards and the behaviour of the primary antagonist force, the mechanised threat known as ARC.

Representatives from Embark Studios stated that the focus of this phase is to refine the balance between survival mechanics and the high-stakes extraction gameplay that defines the experience. The developers confirmed that ARC Raiders is set in a lethal future version of Earth, where players must navigate a landscape ravaged by mysterious machines. The studio emphasised that the Second Expedition serves as a technical bridge, allowing the team to test server stability and the persistence of player-driven economies within the game world.

## Background and Development Evolution

The journey of ARC Raiders has been marked by significant shifts in design philosophy and business models. Originally announced in 2021 as a free-to-play co-operative third-person shooter, the project underwent a fundamental transformation. In May 2023, Embark Studios announced that the game would pivot to a PvPvE (Player versus Player versus Environment) extraction shooter. This decision was made to better align the game with the studio's creative vision and the evolving interests of the multiplayer gaming community.

Following this pivot, the studio further adjusted its strategy by moving away from the free-to-play model. In late 2024, it was confirmed that ARC Raiders would be released as a premium title with a retail price of approximately 40 USD. This shift was intended to ensure a more sustainable development cycle and to avoid the aggressive monetisation strategies often associated with free-to-play titles. The Second Expedition phase, detailed in the February 2026 update, represents the culmination of these strategic changes, showcasing a more polished and focused version of the game than seen in earlier technical tests.

Embark Studios, which also developed the successful first-person shooter The Finals, has utilised its proprietary technology and experience with the Unreal Engine to create the world of ARC Raiders. The studio's pedigree, involving many veterans from the Battlefield franchise, is evident in the game's emphasis on environmental interaction and large-scale encounters.

## Key Developments in the Second Expedition

The Second Expedition update introduces several key developments regarding the game's core loop. As a multiplayer extraction adventure, the primary objective for players, known as Raiders, is to descend from the safety of the underground colony of Speranza into the surface world. Once on the surface, players must scavenge for vital resources, complete specific objectives, and successfully reach an extraction point before being eliminated by either the ARC machines or other rival Raiders.

A central feature of the Second Expedition is the enhanced artificial intelligence governing the ARC units. These mechanised threats are described as a relentless force that reacts to player noise and activity. The update details various classes of ARC, ranging from small, agile scouts to massive, skyscraper-sized entities that require significant coordination to bypass or disable. The "lethal future earth" mentioned in the official snippet is characterised by a dynamic weather system and a day-night cycle, both of which directly impact the visibility and aggression levels of the ARC units.

Furthermore, the update outlines the "Rust Belt," a primary gameplay zone that has been expanded for the Second Expedition. This area features a mix of industrial ruins and overgrown natural environments, providing diverse tactical opportunities for players. The inclusion of more complex verticality in the map design is intended to facilitate the stealth-oriented gameplay that is often necessary to survive encounters with superior mechanised forces.

## Impacts on the Extraction Genre and Industry

The progression of ARC Raiders into its Second Expedition phase has notable implications for the broader video game industry, particularly the extraction shooter sub-genre. For several years, the market has been dominated by titles such as Escape from Tarkov and Hunt: Showdown. ARC Raiders distinguishes itself through its science-fiction setting and its emphasis on a third-person perspective, which contrasts with the first-person view prevalent in most competing titles.

Industry analysts suggest that the premium pricing model adopted by Embark Studios for ARC Raiders could signal a shift in how mid-to-large-scale multiplayer games are brought to market. By charging an upfront fee, the studio aims to provide a more curated experience with a focus on long-term player retention rather than immediate, microtransaction-driven revenue. The success of this model, as tested during the Second Expedition, will likely be monitored by other developers considering similar transitions.

Additionally, the technical achievements of ARC Raiders, specifically regarding its destruction physics and environmental rendering, set a new benchmark for the genre. The ability for players to interact with and destroy parts of the environment to create new paths or traps adds a layer of tactical depth that is currently rare in extraction-based games. This technical prowess is a direct result of the studio's focus on high-end hardware, as the game is developed specifically for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

## Reactions and Community Feedback

Initial reactions to the Second Expedition details have been gathered from community forums and early playtest participants. While official reviews remain under embargo, the general sentiment among the player base reflects an appreciation for the game's atmospheric world-building and the tension inherent in its extraction mechanics. The mysterious nature of the ARC threat remains a point of significant interest, with players speculating on the origins of the machines based on environmental storytelling found within the game.

However, some sections of the community have expressed concerns regarding the difficulty curve. The "lethal" nature of the future Earth, as described by Embark, means that solo players may face significant challenges when encountering squads of Raiders or high-level ARC units. In response to this, the developers have stated that the Second Expedition includes refinements to the matchmaking system and the introduction of "insurance" mechanics for certain types of gear, aimed at mitigating the frustration of losing progress.

The shift to a premium model continues to be a topic of discussion. While many players welcome the move away from free-to-play tropes, others are cautious about the entry price for a multiplayer-only title in a competitive market. Embark Studios has addressed these concerns by promising a robust roadmap of post-launch content that will be included in the initial purchase price, avoiding the "battle pass" fatigue seen in other contemporary shooters.

## Next Steps and Future Roadmap

Looking ahead, the Second Expedition is expected to run for several weeks, during which Embark Studios will collect data on player behaviour, weapon balance, and technical performance. This data will be instrumental in the final stages of development as the studio moves towards a full commercial release. While a specific launch date has not been finalised in the February 2026 update, the studio indicated that the game is in the "polishing and optimisation" phase.

The next steps for ARC Raiders include a series of "Speranza Briefings," which will provide deeper insights into the lore of the underground colony and the characters that inhabit it. These briefings are intended to flesh out the narrative context of the game, explaining why the Raiders are risking their lives on the surface and what the ultimate goal of the resistance against ARC entails.

Furthermore, the studio has confirmed that cross-play and cross-progression will be fully supported at launch, ensuring a unified player base across all platforms. Technical updates will continue to be rolled out to address any issues identified during the Second Expedition, with a particular focus on anti-cheat measures and network latency. As the mechanised threat of ARC continues to loom over the fictional Earth, the real-world development of ARC Raiders appears to be entering its most critical and final phase.

## Technical Specifications and Requirements

To support the visual fidelity and complex physics simulations seen in the Second Expedition, Embark Studios has provided updated system requirements for PC players. The game utilises advanced features of the Unreal Engine, including global illumination and high-density geometry. These technologies are essential for creating the "ravaged" look of the Earth and the intricate designs of the ARC machines.

The developers have noted that while the game is optimised for a wide range of modern hardware, the best experience will be found on systems capable of hardware-accelerated ray tracing. This is particularly relevant for the game's lighting, which plays a crucial role in gameplay, as shadows and light sources can reveal the positions of both Raiders and machines. On consoles, the game targets a stable 60 frames per second at dynamic 4K resolution, ensuring that the fast-paced combat remains fluid.

In conclusion, the "Preparing for your second Expedition" update serves as a comprehensive status report for ARC Raiders. By detailing the mechanics of the ARC threat and the realities of the lethal future Earth, Embark Studios has provided a clear picture of what players can expect. As the project moves closer to its final release, the focus remains on delivering a high-quality, premium extraction adventure that stands out in a crowded digital landscape. Details regarding the exact end date of the Second Expedition and the subsequent transition to the launch version remain unclear, but further announcements are expected in the coming months.
