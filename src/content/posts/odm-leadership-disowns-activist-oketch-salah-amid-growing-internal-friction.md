# ODM Leadership Disowns Activist Oketch Salah Amid Growing Internal Friction

The Orange Democratic Movement has taken a firm and public stance to distance itself from the recent political activities and public engagements of activist Oketch Salah. In a move that signals a tightening of internal discipline within Kenya's most established opposition party, the ODM leadership has formally declared that Salah does not speak for the organization, nor do his actions carry the weight of official party sanction. This development comes at a sensitive time for the movement as it navigates a complex transition period following the passing of its long time leader, the late Raila Odinga.

The official communication, which was released to the public and signed by the National Chairperson Gladys Wanga, leaves little room for ambiguity regarding the party's relationship with the activist. According to the statement, the party felt it was necessary to clarify the boundaries of its association with individuals who may be seen to be acting on its behalf without formal authorization. The leadership expressed a need to protect the integrity of the party's communication channels and ensure that all grassroots mobilization efforts are aligned with the central strategy dictated by the top brass.

## The Official Disassociation by Party Leadership

The statement issued by Gladys Wanga serves as a formal boundary between the institutional framework of the Orange Democratic Movement and the independent initiatives of Oketch Salah. Wanga, who has been instrumental in maintaining party order, emphasized that any statements or engagements undertaken by Salah are strictly personal. The party leadership appears concerned that unauthorized activities could lead to confusion among the rank and file, potentially diluting the official messaging of the movement.

Wanga's statement was explicit in its wording, noting that the Orange Democratic Movement wishes to clarify that any activities, statements, or engagements undertaken by Mr. Oketch Salah are carried out strictly in his personal capacity. The party further clarified that these actions do not represent or bind the movement in any way. This level of public disavowal is often reserved for situations where the party leadership perceives a risk of parallel power structures forming or where individual actions might conflict with the broader diplomatic or political goals of the party.

The National Chairperson's directive also served as a reminder to the broader membership about the importance of hierarchy. By naming Salah specifically, the party has set a precedent that individual popularity or zeal does not bypass the requirement for official clearance. This move is seen by political analysts as an attempt to consolidate power within the established organs of the party, ensuring that the transition into the post Raila Odinga era is marked by stability rather than fragmented activism.

## The Centrality of the Party Secretariat

A significant portion of the party's grievance appears to stem from the bypass of established protocols. In her statement, Wanga reiterated that the Orange Democratic Movement operates through a structured Secretariat. This body is tasked with the coordination of all official programs, ensuring that every rally, press release, and grassroots meeting is vetted and approved. The party leadership emphasized that these activities must be undertaken with the approval and guidance of the leadership, specifically mentioning the role of Dr. Oburu Odinga in this oversight process.

The mention of Dr. Oburu Odinga is particularly noteworthy. As a senior figure within the party and the family of the late leader, his involvement in the guidance of the party signifies a continuation of the legacy and a bridge between the traditional values of the movement and its future direction. By insisting that all activities go through the Secretariat under such guidance, Wanga is reinforcing the idea that ODM is an institution governed by rules, not just a collection of individual supporters.

The warning extended beyond Salah to all grassroots leaders and supporters. Wanga advised that no activities should be organized or conducted in the name of ODM without prior consultation and approval. This directive aims to curb the rise of independent actors who might use the party's symbols, colors, and slogans to advance personal agendas or local rivalries that do not align with the national office's objectives. The party remains committed to order, discipline, and structured engagement in the pursuit of its political objectives.

## Oketch Salah's Personal Rebuttal and Apology

In the wake of the party's stern warning, Oketch Salah released a comprehensive statement of his own. Rather than retreating or showing signs of rebellion, Salah chose to frame his response as a passionate defense of his loyalty to the movement. His statement was characterized by a blend of humility and defiance, as he sought to explain the motivations behind his recent activities. Salah began by stating that he wanted to speak from his heart and very clearly about his intentions.

Salah maintained that his primary goal has always been to popularize and strengthen the Orange Democratic Movement. He expressed a deep belief in the party's history and its foundational principles. In a direct address to the National Chairperson, Salah offered a sincere apology for any friction his actions may have caused. He stated that if he had hurt Chairlady Wanga in the process of his activism, he apologized, asserting that such an outcome was never his intention.

This apology, however, was followed by a robust defense of the need for grassroots energy. Salah argued that for a movement to remain relevant, it must be constantly re-energized and refreshed. He described ODM as a living movement that must keep moving and inspiring people at the local level. This perspective highlights a common tension in political organizations: the balance between the top down control desired by the leadership and the bottom up enthusiasm generated by independent activists.
