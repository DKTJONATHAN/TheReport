## A Week of Transition and Tension

As February 2026 unfolds, Kenya finds itself navigating a complex web of political realignment, economic restructuring, and pressing environmental challenges. From the corridors of power in Nairobi to the protected wilderness of the Rift Valley, the nation is witnessing a series of events that reflect both its ambitions and its deep-seated vulnerabilities. The start of the month has been marked by a flurry of activity, including significant shifts within the opposition, a massive influx of foreign investment, and a growing sense of public unease regarding the rising cost of education and essential services.

The political landscape, in particular, is undergoing a seismic shift. The Orange Democratic Movement, which has long been a cornerstone of Kenyan politics, is currently grappling with internal friction that threatens to redefine its future. Simultaneously, the government is pushing forward with ambitious infrastructure projects and international partnerships, even as it faces criticism over its handling of domestic issues such as fee hikes in technical institutions and the management of national parks.

## Political Fractures and the Battle for Azimio

The internal dynamics of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) have taken centre stage this week, as the party leadership seeks to maintain discipline amidst growing dissent. The party recently took the decisive step of distancing itself from remarks made by Oketch Salah, whose actions reportedly unsettled both the leadership and the rank and file. This move is seen as an attempt to project a united front, yet it highlights the underlying tensions that have been simmering within the party for months.

The friction is not limited to individual members. A public spat has emerged between senior figures, with Oburu Odinga recently criticising Edwin Sifuna following a high profile television interview. The disagreement, which centres on the hierarchy and influence within the party, suggests that the transition of leadership remains a contentious issue. Oburu’s assertion that no individual is bigger than the party serves as a stern reminder to the younger generation of leaders that the old guard still wields significant influence.

Beyond the internal struggles of ODM, the broader Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition is facing its own identity crisis. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta recently presided over a meeting that saw Kalonzo Musyoka appointed as the coalition leader, with Caroli Omondi taking over as Secretary General. However, this move has not been universally welcomed. ODM has publicly rejected these changes, signalling a potential breakdown in the alliance that was formed to challenge the current administration. The rejection of Uhuru backed leadership changes suggests that the coalition is increasingly fractured, leaving the opposition in a state of flux as they look toward the next electoral cycle.

## Economic Ambitions and the Cost of Progress

On the economic front, the Kenyan government continues to court international investment to bolster its development agenda. A significant milestone was reached this week with the announcement that a Dubai based firm, the Maser Group, intends to invest KSh 206 billion into Kenya’s farmland and data centres. This massive Public Private Partnership (PPP) is part of a broader push to enhance food security and digital infrastructure. The government is reportedly considering leasing sections of key food producing regions, such as the Galana Kulalu irrigation scheme, to facilitate this investment. While the move promises to bring modern technology and capital to the agricultural sector, it has also sparked debates about land sovereignty and the long term implications of foreign control over vital resources.

However, the promise of large scale investment stands in stark contrast to the immediate economic pressures facing many Kenyans. The government is currently facing a significant backlash over a sharp increase in tuition fees for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions. Under a new modular curriculum introduced in 2025, fees have nearly doubled, rising from approximately KSh 56,000 to KSh 105,000 annually. This hike has placed a heavy burden on students and their families, leading to widespread protests.

The tension reached a breaking point at the Ollessos National Polytechnic, where students staged night protests against the fee increases. The situation turned volatile as armed police were deployed to disperse the learners, using tear gas to quell the unrest. These protests are a clear indication of the growing frustration among the youth, who feel that the path to self improvement through education is becoming increasingly unaffordable.

## Infrastructure and Urban Management

In Nairobi, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has announced an eight day closure of a major section of the Uhuru Highway to allow for essential maintenance and upgrades. While such projects are necessary for the city’s long term growth, the closure is expected to cause significant disruption to traffic flow. Motorists have been urged to use alternative routes and exercise caution when approaching the affected areas. This infrastructure work coincides with the launch of a new 24 hour emergency command centre for the city, designed to overhaul Nairobi’s disaster response capabilities. The centre will maintain a detailed inventory of fire engines, ambulances, and rescue boats, ensuring that the city is better prepared for emergencies such as the recent gas depot explosion in Donholm, which caused widespread panic among residents.

The government has also been forced to respond to public uproar regarding the cost and availability of passports. The Immigration Services Department has assured the public that swift action is being taken to address a shortage of cheaper passport options. For many Kenyans, the passport is not just a travel document but a gateway to economic opportunities abroad, and any perceived barrier to obtaining one is met with intense scrutiny.

## Environmental Alarms and National Security

Kenya’s natural heritage is also under threat, as a huge wildfire broke out at Lake Nakuru National Park this week. This incident follows a similar fire at Mt. Longonot National Park just three weeks ago, raising concerns about the adequacy of fire prevention and response strategies in the country’s protected areas. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is working to contain the blaze, but the recurring nature of these fires suggests that climate change and human activity are placing unprecedented pressure on Kenya’s ecosystems.

In terms of national security, the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) have joined the United States, the United Kingdom, and 17 other nations in a major maritime security drill known as Cutlass Express 2026. This exercise, conducted in the Indian Ocean, is aimed at boosting domain awareness and the war against insurgents. The U.S. has recently strengthened Kenya’s capabilities through an KSh 8.9 billion runway expansion at Manda Bay, highlighting the strategic importance of Kenya as a regional security partner.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Interior has announced the reopening of the Kenya Somalia border, a move that is expected to benefit miraa traders and strengthen diplomatic ties that have been strained for over a decade. While the reopening is seen as a positive step for regional stability, it also requires heightened vigilance to prevent the cross border movement of extremist elements.

## Legal Battles and Human Rights

The Kenyan judiciary remains a critical arena for the protection of rights and the enforcement of accountability. The High Court recently cleared the way for the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission (EACC) to arrest a senior government official over multibillion shilling graft allegations. The official, the CEO of the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF), had sought to block the arrest, claiming it was a form of political intimidation. The court’s decision reinforces the principle that no individual is above the law, regardless of their position in government.

In another significant ruling, the Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court decision that had struck down the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). This represents a major victory for Members of Parliament, who rely on these funds to initiate projects in their constituencies. However, the legality of the fund remains a point of contention between the judiciary and the legislature, with Chief Justice Martha Koome and Speaker Moses Wetang'ula often finding themselves on opposite sides of the debate.

On a more somber note, the High Court has ordered the Inspector General of Police and the Director of Criminal Investigations to produce an abducted trader from Busia, dead or alive. The case of Ibrahim Mohamed is the latest in a series of enforced disappearances that have been linked to state operators. Human rights organisations, including Amnesty Kenya, continue to call for an end to these practices. As Amnesty Kenya begins its search for a new director to succeed Irungu Houghton, the organisation remains focused on addressing police brutality, digital privacy, and the protection of the right to protest.

## International Relations and the Global Context

Kenya’s role on the global stage continues to evolve, with the nation finding itself caught in the middle of international conflicts and shifting diplomatic priorities. Tragic news emerged from Ukraine this week, where the bodies of two Kenyans were discovered. The individuals had reportedly been fighting for Russia after being lured to Europe with the promise of well paying jobs. This incident highlights the desperate measures some are forced to take in search of economic stability and the dangers of international recruitment schemes.

Meanwhile, the United States government has set a deadline for Kenyans seeking fully funded Fulbright scholarships, providing a glimmer of hope for students looking to further their education abroad. In a significant move for public health, the U.S. administration under Donald Trump has signed a KSh 759 billion spending package that includes relief for HIV and AIDS patients. This comes after concerns that the U.S. might withdraw funding for critical health programmes that thousands of Kenyans rely on.

In the region, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has awarded his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, a military medal for commanding operations against Al Shabaab. This move comes despite threats from the U.S. to review military ties with Uganda following controversial post election remarks and diplomatic clashes. The dynamics in Uganda continue to have a significant impact on regional security and Kenya’s own foreign policy.

## Looking Ahead

As Kenya moves further into 2026, the challenges facing the nation are as diverse as they are daunting. The political class must find a way to navigate internal divisions and provide a clear vision for the future, while the government must balance its developmental ambitions with the immediate needs of its citizens. The rising cost of living, the threat of environmental degradation, and the need for robust human rights protections will remain at the forefront of the national conversation.

Despite these challenges, the resilience of the Kenyan people and the strength of the country’s institutions provide a foundation for hope. Whether through the pursuit of justice in the courts, the advocacy of human rights organisations, or the entrepreneurial spirit of its citizens, Kenya continues to strive for a more prosperous and equitable future. The events of this week serve as a reminder that the journey toward progress is often fraught with difficulty, but it is a journey that the nation remains committed to undertaking.
