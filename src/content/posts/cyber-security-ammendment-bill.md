# Why Kenya’s New Cybercrime Bill Must Be Rejected: A Threat to Your Freedom

Kenya’s **Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Bill, 2025**, signed quietly by President William Ruto on October 15, 2025—the very day the nation mourned the death of Raila Odinga—has sparked an intense nationwide uproar. Trending loudly on social media as #RejectCybercrimeBill, it’s now clear this law is less about protecting Kenyans online and more about controlling you.

This law is a nightmare for privacy, free speech, and human rights. It legalizes invasive surveillance, justifies arbitrary detention, and opens the door to abuse of power hidden behind vague phrases like “cybercrime” and “offensive communication.”

## What Does The Bill Do?

The bill amends the Kenya Information and Communications Act by:

- Forcing ISPs to implement a **meter billing system** tracking every citizen's internet use.
- Mandating ISPs to issue **unique internet meter numbers** to each customer, monitoring usage in astonishing detail.
- Requiring annual submission of detailed user data by ISPs to the Communications Authority.

These technical provisions may sound bureaucratic, but they create a digital architecture ripe for **mass surveillance** and **government overreach**.

Moreover, the bill expands **legal provisions** allowing authorities to:

- Monitor, intercept, and record online communications without judicial oversight.
- Detain suspects on tenuous cyber-related charges.
- Block websites and social media content arbitrarily.
- Punish “offensive comments” or “false information” with up to **10 years in prison and heavy fines**.

## Why This Law Is Dangerous For Kenyans

### 1. Illegal Detentions and Abductions Will Be Justified

The bill’s vague definitions of cyber offenses enable the government to detain or abduct individuals deemed threats without proper judicial process. Security agencies will gain unlimited access to online activities, using digital footprints to target critics and activists swiftly.

### 2. Mass Surveillance Normalized

Millions of Kenyans will have their internet usage tracked daily, creating detailed logs of their private communications. This loss of privacy threatens freedom of expression and undermines constitutional rights, especially for journalists, whistleblowers, and political opponents.

### 3. Censorship and Silencing Dissent

With powers to block or shut down online content, the government can silence anyone inconvenient online. This law empowers digital censorship, killing criticism and debate essential for democracy.

### 4. Threat to Digital Economy and Access

Metered billing combined with detailed monitoring increases costs and restricts access to information—especially hurting students, small businesses, and rural communities dependent on affordable internet.

## The Context Behind The Law’s Timing

Signing the bill on the day Raila Odinga died shows political calculation. The nation was distracted, emotions were high, and opposition voices silenced by grief. This enabled the government to pass one of the most repressive digital laws with little public scrutiny.

## Trending #RejectCybercrimeBill

Citizens nationwide have taken to social media under #RejectCybercrimeBill to voice their anger and concern. Human rights organizations like the **Kenya Human Rights Commission** and **Katiba Institute** have called for the law’s repeal or amendment, citing serious constitutional violations.

## The Bottom Line

This bill is not about protecting Kenyans from cybercrime—it is about **shaping a digital police state**. It threatens everyone’s right to privacy, punishes free thought, and abets abuses by security forces.

Your online life is your private life. You deserve better.
