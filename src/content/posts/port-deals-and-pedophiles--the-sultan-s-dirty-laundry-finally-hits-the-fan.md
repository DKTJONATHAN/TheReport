Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem finally got the boot from DP World, and they’re trying to call it a "resignation" to save face. Please. You don’t just walk away from a chairman and CEO seat "effective immediately" unless the fire is licking your heels. The Epstein files are finally doing what our local laws never could: making these supposedly untouchable "prominent figures" sweat. It turns out the man running global ports was allegedly more interested in "torture videos" and "p*ssyness" than actual shipping logistics.

The most nauseating part for anyone living in the 254 is how he reportedly used Kenya like a personal gift shop for predators. Emails show Bin Sulayem bragging to Jeffrey Epstein about how he could hook him up with then-President Uhuru Kenyatta. He even sent a photo of himself with Ambassador Amina Mohammed just to prove he had the government in his pocket. It’s the same old story - while we’re out here being squeezed by the government - like how the [CA’s 'Safety' Warning Is Just Another Tax Trap for the Broke](/posts/the-ca-s--safety--warning-is-just-another-tax-trap-for-the-broke) - the elites are busy trading favors and god-knows-what-else with international monsters.

The specifics in these emails are enough to make a seasoned Nairobi street cop gag. Between the "misunderstandings" about wanting "p*ssyness" and being asked by Epstein if he "loved the torture video," it’s clear what kind of "business" was really happening behind closed doors. It makes you wonder what really went down when Epstein’s plane landed in Dar-es-Salaam or Nairobi. These people treat East Africa like a lawless playground where they can buy anyone with a title and a pulse.

Even the so-called "saints" are stained by this mess. Sulayem was a co-founder of Prince William’s Earthshot Prize, throwing around a million pounds to buy himself a clean reputation. It’s the classic billionaire playbook: donate to a high-profile charity, get a photo op with a royal, and hope nobody notices the skeletons in your closet are screaming. Now that the British Charity Commission is investigating, that "green" money is looking a lot like blood money.

The irony is that while this scandal is nuking careers in the Middle East and causing tremors in the UK, the Americans seem perfectly fine with the fact that Donald Trump is all over these files too. It’s a global circus where the clowns are in charge of the justice system. For us in Nairobi, this isn’t just news; it’s a reminder that whether it’s a port deal or a charity gala, the people at the top are usually just one leaked email away from a prison cell they’ll probably never actually sit in.
