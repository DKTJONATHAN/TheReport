If you have enough free time to be genuinely offended by a man dancing in Spanish or a politician’s Truth Social meltdown, I envy your lack of real problems. Here we are, watching the world’s most powerful man-child trade insults with a reggaeton star, and we’re supposed to believe this "culture war" actually matters. It’s a scripted circus designed to keep you from noticing how thin the bread is getting.

Donald Trump is back at it, screaming into the digital void about "standards of excellence" and "disgusting" dancing. It’s the same old playlist. He’s using a halftime show to pivot back to his favorite buzzwords, the stock market and the 401(k)s, as if a green line on a screen in New York puts food on the table for a single mother in a Nairobi bedsit. He calls the show a "slap in the face" to the country’s progress. The real slap in the face is the audacity to pretend a 15-minute musical set is a national crisis while actual systemic rot goes ignored.

Then you have Bad Bunny. Don’t get it twisted, his "ICE out" activism is a nice aesthetic for a Grammy stage, but let’s not pretend it’s a revolution. It’s easy to be a rebel when you’re wearing designer clothes and being broadcast to millions. These celebrities and politicians feed off each other. Trump needs a villain to rile up his base, and Bad Bunny needs a foil to keep his "edgy" brand alive. They are two sides of the same counterfeit coin, playing a game where the only losers are the people actually watching.

This obsession with optics and "pageantry" over substance isn't unique to the Americans. We see the same script played out in our own backyard. While the elite argue over who is more "patriotic" or "moral," the ground is shifting beneath them. People are tired of the noise. It’s the same disconnect we see when leaders focus on PR stunts while the economy crumbles, a reality that explains [Ruto's 2027 Problem: Why Kenya's President Faces Historic Electoral Backlash](/posts/ruto-2027-problem-electoral-backlash). When you spend all your energy on the performance, you shouldn't be surprised when the audience finally stops clapping and starts looking for the exit.

The NFL is worried about kickoffs being "safe," and Trump is worried about the "toughness" of the game. Meanwhile, the rest of us are worried about the price of fuel and the fact that "success" is becoming a word only the rich get to define. 

So, go ahead. Pick a side. Defend the "Greatness of America" or "Música Urbana." Just realize that while you’re arguing on Instagram, the people you’re defending are laughing all the way to the bank, and your reality hasn’t changed one bit. The show isn't just on the stage; the show is the fact that we’re still falling for this.
