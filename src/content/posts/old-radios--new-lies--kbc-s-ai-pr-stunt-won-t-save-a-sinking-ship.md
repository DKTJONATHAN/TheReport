If you thought the heat in Nairobi was bad, try listening to the corporate PR coming out of Harry Thuku Road. KBC, our "illustrious" national broadcaster, spent the better part of the week patting itself on the back because they’ve finally discovered the word “Artificial Intelligence.” Managing Director Agnes Kalekye Nguna stood up there with a straight face, telling us that AI won’t replace the “human heart” of radio. Please. We all know what "human heart" means in a government parastatal - it means someone’s uncle is still holding onto a job they don’t understand while the equipment gathers dust. They call it “Human Trust First,” but anyone who has dealt with government systems knows it’s usually “Tenders First, Service Never.” They’re framing AI as a "next wave transmitter," but let’s be real. This is the same house that has been "celebrating" its history since the British were still wearing safari suits in 1928. While they talk about "ethical use" and "guardian principles," the reality is that the average Kenyan only tunes into KBC when the electricity goes out and the remote is lost. The irony is thick enough to cut with a panga. They promise that no Kenyan will be left in the dark, yet we’ve seen how "technology" is handled in this country. Remember the [CHAN 2024 Ticketing Scam](/posts/CHAN-tickets-Scam)? That’s what happens when you mix "new tech" with "old systems." You get fake tickets, political hoarding, and a mwananchi who is very much left in the dark. Instead of fixing the signal or paying talent what they’re worth, they brought in Mike Rua and the Gor Mahia choir to chant and dance in jeans. It’s the classic Nairobi play: if the ship is sinking, just play the music louder. They claim no algorithm will sit in the editorial chair, but honestly, an algorithm might actually be an improvement over the tired, scripted bias we’ve been fed for decades. They want us to believe AI is a tool for "reach and understanding." I call it a tool for more consultancy fees and "capacity building" workshops that lead nowhere. KBC embracing AI is like a donkey putting on a Ferrari sticker; it’s still a donkey, and it’s still going to be slow. Keep your "synthetic voices" and your "sacred duties." We know the vibe. It’s all vibes and insha'Allah until the next budget cycle.
