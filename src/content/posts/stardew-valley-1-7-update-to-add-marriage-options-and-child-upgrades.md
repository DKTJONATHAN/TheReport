# Stardew Valley 1.7 Update to Add Marriage Options and Child Upgrades

On 4 February 2026, developer Eric Barone, known professionally as ConcernedApe, confirmed that the next major update for the farming simulation title Stardew Valley will introduce significant changes to the game's social and family systems. According to a report by Eurogamer.net, the version 1.7 update is set to include two additional characters available for marriage and a comprehensive upgrade to the mechanics governing children within the game. This announcement follows the long-standing tradition of the developer providing substantial post-launch content for the title, which originally debuted in 2016.

The confirmation of version 1.7 marks a continued commitment to the title, even as Barone works on his upcoming project, Haunted Chocolatier. The Eurogamer report indicates that the primary focus of this update is to expand the interpersonal depth of the Pelican Town community, specifically addressing long-standing player feedback regarding the utility and behaviour of offspring.

## Background of Stardew Valley Development

Stardew Valley has maintained a consistent presence in the gaming industry since its initial release on PC. Developed entirely by Eric Barone, the game was initially inspired by the Harvest Moon series but expanded upon the genre with deeper combat, crafting, and social elements. Over the past decade, the game has transitioned from a solo project to a global phenomenon, selling millions of copies across multiple platforms, including PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.

The development history of the game is defined by its major version updates. Version 1.1, released shortly after the game's launch, added the first set of new marriage candidates, Shane and Emily, who were previously non-romanceable NPCs. Subsequent updates, such as version 1.4, introduced the "Everything" update, which added significant quality-of-life improvements and the Movie Theatre. Version 1.5 was the largest update in the game's history at that time, introducing Ginger Island, a new endgame region, and the Beach Farm layout.

Most recently, version 1.6 focused on expanding the technical infrastructure for modding while adding new festivals, items, and dialogue. The announcement of version 1.7, as reported by Eurogamer, suggests that Barone is returning to the core social mechanics that define the player's domestic life within the game.

## Key Developments in Update 1.7

The central pillars of the 1.7 update, as confirmed by ConcernedApe, are the two new marriage candidates and the "more interesting" children. While the specific identities of the two new characters have not been officially disclosed in the initial Eurogamer report, the addition of new romanceable NPCs is a significant event for the community. In previous updates, marriage candidates were selected based on their popularity among the fanbase and their existing narrative arcs within Pelican Town.

The second major component of the update involves the children that players can have with their spouses. In the current version of the game, children progress through four stages of growth: baby (in crib), crawler, toddler, and child. However, once they reach the final stage, they remain toddlers indefinitely and do not contribute to the farm or engage in complex dialogue. The Eurogamer report states that Barone has confirmed these characters will be "upgraded" to be more interesting. While the exact nature of these upgrades remains unclear, the phrasing suggests a move towards more dynamic interactions, potential growth beyond the toddler stage, or unique personality traits inherited from the player's spouse.

## Impacts on Gameplay and Social Mechanics

The introduction of new marriage candidates typically alters the social landscape of Pelican Town. Each marriageable character in Stardew Valley comes with a unique set of "heart events," which are scripted cutscenes that reveal the character's backstory and personality. Adding two new candidates implies the addition of at least twenty new heart events, assuming the standard ten-heart progression remains in place. This also necessitates new dialogue for various seasons, weather conditions, and festivals.

The upgrade to children is expected to have a more profound impact on the long-term gameplay loop. For many players, the domestic aspect of Stardew Valley serves as a primary motivator for progression. By making children more interactive or functional, the update addresses a common critique that the family system feels static compared to the evolving nature of the farm itself. If children are given the ability to age further or assist with farm chores, it would align Stardew Valley more closely with other titles in the life-simulation genre that feature multi-generational gameplay.

Furthermore, these changes may influence the "perfection" rating, a metric introduced in version 1.5 that tracks a player's total completion of the game's content. New characters and social milestones would likely be integrated into these requirements, providing veteran players with new objectives to achieve.

## Reactions and Industry Context

The announcement has generated significant interest within the gaming community, as Stardew Valley updates are often viewed as benchmarks for post-launch support in the indie industry. Eric Barone's approach to development, which involves providing large-scale content updates free of charge, has been widely praised by critics and players alike. According to Eurogamer, the confirmation of 1.7 reinforces the idea that the game remains a "living project" despite its age.

Industry analysts note that the timing of the 1.7 update is strategic. By continuing to update Stardew Valley, Barone maintains a highly engaged audience that is likely to transition to his next game, Haunted Chocolatier. The focus on children and marriage also suggests a focus on the "cosy gaming" demographic, a market segment that has seen exponential growth in recent years.

Within the player base, discussion has turned toward which existing NPCs might be elevated to marriage candidate status. Characters such as Wizard, Marnie, or Sandy have frequently been requested by the community in the past. However, the Eurogamer report does not specify if the new candidates are existing NPCs or entirely new characters introduced in the update.

## Next Steps and Release Timeline

As of the report on 4 February 2026, a specific release date for version 1.7 has not been provided. Historically, ConcernedApe has followed a "when it is ready" philosophy, often announcing release dates only a few weeks before the update goes live. It is also standard practice for Stardew Valley updates to debut on PC first, with console and mobile versions following after a period of porting and certification.

The Eurogamer report indicates that Barone is currently in the active development phase of these features. Given the complexity of overhauling the child AI and social scripts, the development period may be extensive. Players are advised to monitor official channels, including the developer's social media and the official Stardew Valley blog, for further details on the identities of the new candidates and the specific mechanics of the child upgrades.

In the interim, the community continues to engage with the content provided in version 1.6. The technical improvements made in the previous update are expected to facilitate a smoother rollout for 1.7, particularly for players who use mods. Barone has previously stated that he aims to minimise the disruption to the modding community with each subsequent update.

The 1.7 update represents another chapter in the ongoing evolution of Stardew Valley. By focusing on the domestic and social aspects of the game, ConcernedApe is addressing some of the most persistent requests from the player base, ensuring that the title remains a leading example of the farming simulation genre. Further details regarding the update's scope and additional features are expected to emerge as development progresses throughout 2026.
