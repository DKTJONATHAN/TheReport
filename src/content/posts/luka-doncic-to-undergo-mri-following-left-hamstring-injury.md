# Luka Doncic to Undergo MRI Following Left Hamstring Injury

## Incident Overview and Initial Assessment

According to official reports from the Associated Press and team medical staff, Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic is scheduled to undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan following an early exit during a regular-season fixture against the Philadelphia 76ers. The incident occurred on 6 February 2026, during the first half of play, leaving the league's leading scorer unable to complete the contest.

The injury took place with 3:03 remaining in the second quarter. Observers noted that Doncic appeared to experience discomfort in his left leg following a routine offensive sequence at the far end of the court. While the specific mechanism of the injury, whether a sudden acceleration or a mechanical slip, remains under review by team analysts, the immediate physical response was evident. Doncic was seen limping significantly as he transitioned toward the bench before being escorted by training staff directly to the locker room for further evaluation.

Initial reports from the arena indicated that Doncic would not return to the game, a decision made by the medical team to prevent further aggravation of the site. The primary diagnosis provided to the media shortly after the incident was a left hamstring strain, though the severity of the tissue damage cannot be fully determined until the results of the MRI are processed. The Mavericks' medical department has not yet released a specific grade for the strain, as these classifications rely heavily on the imaging data expected later today.

## Medical Context of Hamstring Injuries in the NBA

The hamstring is a group of three muscles running along the back of the thigh, which are critical for the explosive movements, deceleration, and lateral shifting required in professional basketball. In the context of an elite athlete like Doncic, who carries a high usage rate and significant minutes per game, the hamstring is under constant physiological stress. According to sports medicine experts, hamstring injuries are among the most common soft tissue ailments in the NBA, often requiring a cautious approach to rehabilitation to avoid recurrence.

An MRI is the standard diagnostic tool for such injuries because it allows clinicians to visualise the extent of muscle fibre disruption. A Grade 1 strain typically involves overstretching without significant tearing, usually resulting in a recovery period of one to two weeks. A Grade 2 strain involves a partial tear, which can sideline a player for three to six weeks. A Grade 3 strain, the most severe, involves a complete rupture of the muscle or tendon and may require surgical intervention, though such cases are less frequent in non-contact scenarios.

The timing of the MRI is crucial. Medical professionals often wait 12 to 24 hours after the initial injury to allow localised swelling to subside, which ensures a clearer image of the affected area. For Doncic, the results of this scan will dictate the entirety of his rehabilitation programme and determine whether he will be available for the upcoming stretch of the season.

## Statistical Impact on Team Performance

Luka Doncic’s absence presents a significant challenge for the Dallas Mavericks, given his current status as the NBA’s scoring leader. At the time of the injury, Doncic was averaging over 34 points per game, alongside high-volume contributions in rebounds and assists. His role in the Mavericks' offensive system is foundational, as he serves as the primary playmaker and focal point for opposing defensive schemes.

Statistically, the Mavericks' offensive rating, a measure of points scored per 100 possessions, drops significantly when Doncic is off the floor. His ability to create high-percentage shots for teammates through "gravity," where multiple defenders are drawn to him, is a component that is difficult to replicate with reserve players. In the games leading up to the Philadelphia matchup, Doncic had been responsible for nearly 50 percent of the team’s total points through his own scoring and assists.

The impact also extends to the team’s rotation. Without Doncic, the coaching staff must redistribute approximately 36 to 38 minutes of playing time. This typically results in increased usage for secondary ball-handlers and a shift in the team’s tactical approach, often moving from a slow-paced, isolation-heavy style to a more transition-based offence. The loss of a scoring leader during a critical portion of the February schedule could have long-term implications for the team’s seeding in the Western Conference.

## Historical Context of Doncic’s Physical Durability

Throughout his career, Luka Doncic has maintained a relatively consistent presence on the court, though he has dealt with various lower-extremity injuries. Most notably, he has experienced several bouts of ankle sprains and calf strains in previous seasons. In March 2024, a similar hamstring concern forced him to miss a brief period of play, highlighting a recurring vulnerability in his lower-body mechanics.

The Mavericks' training staff has historically been conservative with Doncic’s recovery timelines. The organisation has invested heavily in "load management" and preventative physiotherapy to mitigate the risks associated with his high workload. Despite these efforts, the cumulative fatigue of a long NBA season, combined with international play during the off-season, remains a factor that experts cite when discussing his injury profile.

Comparisons have been drawn to other high-usage guards in the league who have suffered similar hamstring issues. Players such as James Harden and Chris Paul have seen their seasons interrupted by recurring hamstring strains, which often require meticulous management of minutes upon return. The Mavericks' front office will likely look at these historical precedents when determining how quickly to reintegrate Doncic into the active roster.

## Strategic Adjustments and Coaching Response

Following the game, Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd addressed the media regarding the immediate plans for the roster. While Kidd refrained from providing a definitive timeline, he emphasised the "next man up" philosophy that teams must adopt when a star player is sidelined. The coaching staff will need to rely more heavily on the supporting cast, including Kyrie Irving and the team’s bench unit, to fill the void left by Doncic’s production.

Tactically, the Mavericks may be forced to alter their defensive strategies as well. While Doncic is primarily known for his offensive prowess, his size allows the team to switch defensively across multiple positions. Without him, the team may lose some of that versatility, requiring more traditional defensive alignments.

The Philadelphia 76ers, for their part, capitalised on Doncic’s exit during the game, adjusting their defensive pressure to target the Mavericks' remaining ball-handlers. This game served as a preview of the challenges Dallas will face in the coming weeks if the MRI reveals a significant tear. Opposing coaches will likely implement aggressive blitzing and double-team strategies against the Mavericks' secondary scorers, testing the depth of the roster.

## Comparative Recovery Timelines and League Precedents

Data from the NBA’s injury database suggests that the average time lost for a hamstring strain is approximately 13 days, or roughly 5.5 games. However, this average accounts for all players and does not specifically factor in the unique demands placed on a primary initiator like Doncic. For elite guards, the recovery is often extended to ensure that the "explosive" capacity of the muscle is fully restored before returning to high-intensity competition.

In recent seasons, several high-profile players have returned too early from hamstring injuries, only to suffer a setback within the first two games of their return. This "re-injury" phenomenon is a primary concern for the Mavericks' medical staff. Consequently, the rehabilitation process will likely involve a series of progressive milestones, including stationary shooting, individual court work, and eventually full-contact practice, before Doncic is cleared for game action.

The league's medical community generally agrees that a cautious approach in February is preferable to a lingering issue in April and May, when the playoffs begin. Given the Mavericks' aspirations for a deep post-season run, the priority will be ensuring Doncic is at 100 percent capacity, even if it results in a temporary slide in the regular-season standings.

## Future Outlook and Rehabilitation Protocols

The next steps for Luka Doncic involve a period of rest and inflammation control immediately following the MRI. Once the extent of the injury is confirmed, he will begin a structured rehabilitation protocol. This typically starts with isometric exercises to maintain muscle activation without putting undue stress on the healing fibres. As the tissue repairs, the focus will shift to eccentric strengthening, which is considered the gold standard for preventing future hamstring injuries.

The Mavericks are expected to provide a formal update on Doncic’s status within the next 24 to 48 hours. This update will likely include a re-evaluation date, which serves as a tentative window for his return. Until then, the team will have to navigate a difficult schedule without their leading scorer.

The broader implications for the NBA are also significant. As the scoring leader, Doncic is a central figure in the race for the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. League rules regarding the minimum number of games played to qualify for end-of-season awards mean that any extended absence could impact his eligibility for these honours. However, the primary focus for both the player and the organisation remains the long-term health of his left leg and his availability for the remainder of the 2025-2026 campaign.
