Both men were immediately taken into custody and moved to the JKIA police station for interrogation. Investigators are currently looking into whether Ali is part of a larger syndicate that specializes in creating high quality forged European and British residency documents for African nationals seeking to migrate. The sophistication of the forgery has raised concerns about the re
