# Kenya is Not for Sale to Adani

I was sitting at a small cafe in Upper Hill yesterday. I watched the rain pound the pavement. The smell of wet dust and exhaust fumes filled the air. Across the street, men in expensive Italian suits stepped out of heavy black SUVs. They walked into the Treasury building with leather briefcases and smug smiles. These men are not here to build Kenya. They are here to sell it. I could not lie to myself as I watched them. I felt a cold knot of anger in my chest. We are witnessing the biggest corporate heist in the history of this republic.

Here is the thing about our current financial situation. The government tells us we are broke. They say the treasury is empty. They claim we have no choice but to invite "private investors" to manage our critical infrastructure. But when you look at the fine print, these are not investors. They are vultures. The Adani Group is at the center of this storm. They want our airport. They want our electricity transmission lines. They want the very veins and arteries of our economy. Let that sink in for a moment.

Kenyans are tired of being lied to by people who earn six-figure salaries off our taxes. We are told these Public-Private Partnerships are the only way forward. It is a lie. It is a convenient narrative designed to bypass the Constitution. It is a way to avoid the scrutiny of Parliament. It is a way to fill the pockets of a few well-connected individuals while the rest of us struggle to buy unga. I saw the faces of the airport workers protesting last week. They are terrified. They should be. We all should be.

## The Ghost of the JKIA Deal

Let us talk about the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. This is the gateway to East Africa. It is a symbol of our national pride. Now, the government wants to hand it over to Adani for **30 years**. Think about that. Three decades of our main airport being run by a foreign private entity that has a track record of controversy across the globe. They are promising to spend **230 billion shillings** to modernize the airport. They say we need a new runway. They say the terminals are old.

I have walked through JKIA many times. Yes, the roofs leak when it rains. Yes, the power goes out sometimes. But does a leaking roof justify selling the entire house? Of course not. You fix the roof. You do not hand over the title deed to a stranger who promises to paint the walls. When you combine the strategic importance of JKIA + the secrecy of this deal + the lack of competitive bidding, you get a recipe for disaster. Why was there no open tender? Why was this deal cooked in the dark?

The government claims this is a "Privately Initiated Proposal." That is just fancy language for a deal that was brought through the back door. There was no public participation that actually mattered. There was no transparency. I saw the documents that leaked online. The terms are insulting. They want tax breaks. They want a guaranteed return on investment. They want to control who works there. This is not a partnership. It is a surrender.

## The Power Grid in Chains

But it does not stop at the airport. They are coming for our lights too. The deal between KETRACO and Adani Energy Solutions is even more frightening. We are talking about **95 billion shillings** for the construction of transmission lines and substations. Again, this was done behind closed doors. They say we need these lines to stop the frequent blackouts. I agree we need better infrastructure. Every Kenyan who has sat in the dark because of a transformer blast agrees.

However, the cost is what should make your blood boil. We are committing to pay Adani billions of shillings every year for the next **30 years**. This money will come directly from our electricity bills. Your tokens will get more expensive. Your manufacturing costs will go up. Everything in this country will cost more because we decided to outsource our national grid to a private company from India. Let me be clear. This is a debt disguised as an investment.

We are already struggling with a national debt that exceeds **10 trillion shillings**. We are spending more on debt service than on healthcare or education. Now, we are adding these "contingent liabilities" to the books. These are hidden debts. If the project does not make enough money, the Kenyan taxpayer will have to top it up. We are taking all the risk while Adani takes all the profit. Here's what needs to happen. We need to stop pretending that this is "free" money.

## The IMF Shadow Over Nairobi

Why is this happening now? The answer lies in the corridors of the IMF and the World Bank. They have put a gun to our head. They want their money back. They are demanding "fiscal consolidation." This is just a code word for "sell everything that isn't nailed down." Our leaders have borrowed so much that they have lost the ability to say no. They are desperate for any cash infusion that keeps the lights on at State House for another week.

I see the same patterns repeating. We saw it with the SGR. We saw it with the Eurobonds. Now we are seeing it with these PPPs. It is a cycle of predatory lending and corrupt implementation. The people at the top get their "commissions" in offshore accounts. The people at the bottom get the bill. When you combine a desperate government + a greedy corporation + a lack of oversight, the citizen always loses. This is not just a finance issue. This is a sovereignty issue.

The global financial system is rigged against countries like Kenya. I know this. You know this. But our own leaders are the ones holding the pen. They are the ones signing these lopsided contracts. They treat the country like a kiosk. They act like they are selling their own goats at a market in Gatundu. They forget that these assets belong to the people. They belong to the children who have not been born yet. We are stealing from the future to pay for the mistakes of the present.

## The Cost of Staying Silent

I walk through the streets of Nairobi and I see the struggle. I see the youth with degrees selling sweets in traffic. I see the mothers waking up at 4 AM to go to Marikiti. These people pay taxes. Every time they buy a loaf of bread, they are contributing to the national cake. Does the government think about them when they sign a **95 billion shilling** deal with Adani? I doubt it. They are too busy looking at the shiny brochures and the "feasibility studies" written by consultants who have never stepped foot in a Kibera slum.

The silence from some quarters is deafening. Where is the opposition? Where are the "watchdogs"? Many of them have been swallowed by the broad-based government. They have been fed with positions and perks. Now their mouths are full, so they cannot bark. It is left to the ordinary Kenyan. It is left to the Gen Z protesters who stood their ground in June. It is left to the lawyers who are fighting these cases in court. We cannot afford to be tired.

If we let the Adani deal pass, what is next? Will they sell the port of Mombasa? Will they sell our national parks? Will they sell the water we drink? There is no limit to the greed of a government that has run out of ideas. They have failed to grow the economy. They have failed to stop corruption. Now they are selling the furniture to pay the rent. Think about that. What happens when the furniture is all gone?

## A Pattern of Corporate Capture

This is not just a Kenyan problem. We have seen this movie before in other countries. Look at what happened in Sri Lanka. Look at what happened in parts of South America. When a single large conglomerate gets too close to the levers of power, the democracy dies. Adani is not just a company. It is a political force. Their rise in India is tied directly to their proximity to power. Now they are exporting that model to Africa.

Kenya is a strategic hub. We are the gateway to the entire continent. That is why they want us. They don't care about our development. They care about their bottom line. They want to control the trade routes. They want to control the energy flow. When you control a country's airport and its power grid, you control the country. Period. I could not lie and say this is about "efficiency." It is about power and control.

We must demand to see the contracts. Not a summary. Not a press release. We want the full documents. We want to see the "force majeure" clauses. We want to see the arbitration terms. Why should a dispute about a Kenyan airport be decided in a court in London or Singapore? Why are we so afraid of our own legal system? The answer is simple. They know these deals cannot stand the light of day.

## The Way Forward for Kenya

We are told we are "crying for nothing." We are told we are "anti-development." This is the oldest trick in the book. If you question a bad deal, you are labeled an enemy of progress. But real progress does not happen in the dark. Real progress does not involve mortgaging our children's future to a foreign billionaire. Real progress is built on transparency, competition, and the rule of law.

Kenyans need to demand a complete moratorium on all major PPP deals until a full audit is conducted. We need to know who the local partners are. We know how this works in Nairobi. There is always a "local director" who is a proxy for a powerful politician. We need to follow the money. We need to know who is getting the kickbacks. Only then can we have a real conversation about investment.

The time for "polite" engagement is over. Our economy is on life support. The doctor is trying to sell our kidneys to pay for the hospital bed. We need to wake up and realize that no one is coming to save us. Not the IMF. Not the World Bank. Certainly not Adani. We are the ones we have been waiting for. We must protect what is ours with everything we have.

1. Kenyans must demand the immediate publication of all Adani-related contracts and feasibility studies to ensure total transparency.
2. The Law Society of Kenya and civil society should move to court to challenge the constitutionality of the "Privately Initiated Proposal" framework used for these deals.
3. Every citizen must contact their Member of Parliament to demand a public inquiry into the KETRACO and JKIA deals before any further implementation occurs.
