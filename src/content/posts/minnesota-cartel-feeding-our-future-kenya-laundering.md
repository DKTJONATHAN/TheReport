# The Minnesota Cartel: How Feeding Our Future Gang Laundered KSh 32.5 Billion into Kenyan Resorts and Politics

Let me take you inside one of the biggest financial scandals to ever hit the Kenyan diaspora, a story most headlines gloss over but federal indictments expose in brutal detail. The Feeding Our Future fraud ring stole $250 million USD—that's roughly KSh 32.5 billion—from American child nutrition programs during COVID, and a massive chunk of that dirty money flowed straight back to Kenya through luxury resorts, Eastleigh real estate booms, and political influence peddling among Somali Kenyan MPs. These weren't desperate refugees scraping by. They were connected Minneapolis elites who turned US taxpayer checks into beachfront empires in Diani while hosting fundraisers for visiting Garissa and Wajir governors.

Abdiaziz Shafii Farah built a $28 million fraud machine through Empire Cuisine while his network bought Karibu Palms Resort on the Kwale coast. Abdi Nur Salah, senior policy aide to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, registered shell companies claiming to feed thousands. Liban Alishire funneled $1.6 million into Kenyan property disguised through hawala brokers. This wasn't charity gone wrong. It was a sophisticated transnational syndicate that exploited America's welfare system to fund Nairobi power plays and coastal getaways. Let me walk you through the indicted players, the exact money trails investigators traced, how hawala moved billions undetected, and why Minnesota suddenly became slang for suspicious cash flooding Eastleigh developments.

## The Indicted Masterminds Who Turned Soup Kitchens into Syndicates

Federal prosecutors didn't just grab random names. They built cases against specific operators who positioned themselves as community saviors while siphoning child nutrition funds meant for poor Minneapolis kids. These guys controlled non-profits claiming to serve thousands but delivered zero meals while wiring millions overseas.

Abdiaziz Shafii Farah ran Empire Cuisine and Market as the fraud empire's core. Prosecutors say his companies fraudulently claimed over $28 million USD, roughly KSh 3.6 billion. He didn't stop at stealing. Farah bought a $1 million lakefront mansion in Prior Lake, Minnesota plus multiple luxury vehicles. When indictments dropped his brother Abdiaziz Farah got caught plotting to bribe a juror with $120,000 cash stuffed in a Hallmark gift bag, a move straight out of mafia playbooks.

Abdi Nur Salah brought political protection to the operation. As senior policy aide inside Minneapolis City Hall he registered Stigma-Free International as a shell feeding thousands. His government access deflected early scrutiny as racism accusations while his network cashed Treasury checks. Salah proved fraudsters needed insiders to survive audits and media questions.

Liban Alishire served as president of Community Enhancement Services claiming over $1.6 million USD, KSh 208 million. Investigators traced his cut directly to Kenya where he bought Karibu Palms Resort in Diani disguised through layered shell holdings. While claiming to feed Minnesota schoolchildren Alishire built coastal hospitality infrastructure locals couldn't touch.

## The Kenyan Money Trail: Resorts, Real Estate, and MP Fundraisers

Stolen funds didn't stay in Minnesota bank accounts. DOJ financial forensics followed wire transfers and hawala cash flows straight to Kenyan assets. The Minnesota diaspora became a mandatory campaign funding stop for Somali Kenyan politicians seeking diaspora dollars.

Fraudsters hosted lavish Minneapolis receptions for visiting MPs from Garissa, Wajir, and Somali Regional State leaders. Photo ops in hotel ballrooms signaled back home: these guys hold the cash. Stolen KSh 32.5 billion warped Nairobi politics creating pay-to-play pipelines where Minnesota photo ops translated to campaign contributions and development contracts.

Eastleigh exploded with unexplainable property booms. FBI tracers identified direct wires to Nairobi developers pricing locals out completely. "Minnesota money" entered Sheng slang for suspicious cash flooding Kilimani high-rises and Eastlands malls. Hawala brokers converted Minneapolis withdrawals into Nairobi payouts letting fraudsters spend American welfare dollars on Kenyan concrete.

## How Hawala Moved Billions Past Bank Watchdogs

DOJ pieced together the laundering blueprint these operators perfected:

First came extraction. Treasury checks deposited into legitimate-sounding non-profits like Mind Foundry Learning.

Then layering. Checks written to fake suppliers owned by cousins or siblings claiming food deliveries that never happened.

Flight phase followed. Cash withdrawals hit $10,000 plus per transaction handed straight to Minneapolis hawala brokers.

Finally arrival. Equivalent funds released in Nairobi paid to contractors building resorts and apartments.

Hawala's trust-based off-ledger system evaded bank compliance while moving billions seamlessly across oceans.

## From Minneapolis Soup Kitchens to Diani Beachfront Empires

This operation exposed how a tight network of connected individuals hijacked an entire diaspora's reputation to fund personal empires. Abdiaziz Shafii Farah's $28 million theft funded lakefront luxury. Liban Alishire's resort purchase disguised coastal wealth. Abdi Nur Salah's City Hall access bought time.

The KSh 32.5 billion stain lingers across communities where Minnesota suddenly means more than opportunity. It means suspicion around every flashy developer, every MP's diaspora fundraiser, every untraceable Eastleigh high-rise. Fraudsters turned child nutrition programs into transnational crime fuel proving connected elites exploit systems from both ends—stealing abroad, spending at home—while communities clean up the reputational wreckage.
